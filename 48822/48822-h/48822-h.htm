<h2>RECORD OF THE DOINGS<br />

OF THE<br />

11TH REG. OF MISSOURI VOLUNTEERS.</h2>


<p>Being anxious to serve my country, I walked to Springfield, Illinois, a distance
of twenty-five miles. I arrived there early in the evening, and took up
lodging with a German that night, which was on the 14th day of July, 1861.
There were several recruiting officers enlisting men for cavalry or infantry.
Andrew J. Weber was enlisting a company for an infantry regiment, which I
joined. There were then about thirty members. After remaining here, for a
few days, boarding at the Owen House, we got on board the cars, which were
in waiting, to carry us to our destination.</p>

<p>Sorrowful were the scenes at parting from friends to go from their homes to
defend their rights and liberty, many to fall victims of this unholy rebellion.
As I was a stranger to the company, I had no regrets at leaving, as my friends
were far away. The cars blowed their whistle, and amid the cheers of the people,
and waving of handkerchiefs, we left Springfield. Our destination being
Missouri, we arrived at night at a place called Illinoistown, opposite <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis,
and here we remained all night, and next morning we all went down to the
river and washed. We were then ordered to fall in to go across the river.
Company C accompanied us, commanded by Captain Moses Warner. The two
companies fell in and formed in four ranks, and the command was given, and
we started to the river; we soon arrived on the bank. There was a ferry boat
in waiting to carry us across, we marched board, and the boat soon landed us
below <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, where the command was formed in line, and it was soon on its
way to the arsenal. We arrived there early in the day. The day was warm,
and the streets were dusty, which made it quite disagreeable marching. We
were not molested on the way. Most of us were without arms. The people
lined the sidewalks as we passed.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the arsenal rations were issued to us, and we eat what we
got with a good relish, as we had eat nothing since leaving Springfield the day
before. Most of the boys were without money. After staying here for a few
hours, the command was ordered to fall in and we were went from here to
Marine Hospital, where we remained several weeks. It was here we experienced
the duties of a soldier. We quartered in a long low building, with straw and
plank to lay on. Provisions were good enough, such as they were, and as we
had no conveniences prepared, we labored under difficulties to get enough to
eat.</p>

<p>Commenced drilling, and drilled eight hours a day. Our progress was very
slow at first, as our commanders were not very proficient in drill. But we soon
learned to keep step and the other changes. This continued until one day we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>marched down to the arsenal, were sworn in as a regiment, and drew our arms.
We had previously no arms but some old flint lock muskets, most of them without
bayonets. After drawing our equipments we returned to quarters, and in a
few days the order came to prepare for marching.</p>

<p>The regiment marched to the bank of the river, stacked arms, and there we
remained until evening, awaiting the boat, which arrived at last, and the bugle
sounded, and the order came to go on board the boat. We fell in and marched
about a mile, when we got on board of the boat awaiting us at the landing.
Everything being ready, the boat soon left the landing, and she headed down
the river. Next day we landed at Cape Girardeau, Missouri, August 7th, 1861.
The regiment soon landed, stacked arms, and men were detailed out of each
company to unload the boat. It was hard work, as we had to roll the barrels
and hogsheads up a very high hill. But we were strong and healthy, soon put
every thing on shore.</p>

<p>We carried our things into an old mill, which was deserted. This was to be
our quarters for a while&mdash;company B on one side of the room, company C the
other, in the second story. The regiment was under command of <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> David
A. Bayles, a captain in three months' service. He was severe on us. We
had to drill eight hours a day, and there was a great deal of fatigue duty to do.
The situation of Cape Girardeau when we arrived:&mdash;The city is built on the
bank of the Mississippi river, and back of it was very high bluffs, and it was
defended by the 8th Missouri and 20th Illinois regiments, some Missouri home
guards, cavalry and infantry. There was one small fort, partly finished, no
guns mounted, every street was strongly guarded, sentinels standing on every
corner, and no person allowed to pass without a written permit from headquarters.
Patrols patrolled the town night and day. The citizens treated us quite
civilly as long as we remained here.</p>

<p>We were here but a short time when the report was brought to headquarters
that a rebel force was marching on us with a heavy siege piece. The report we
found to be true, as a deserter informed us afterwards. The alarm soon spread
through the camps, and all was in commotion. Every man was ordered under
arms, and three companies of the 11th Missouri regiment were ordered to go
out and act as picket. Company B was one of the companies detailed. It was
early in the evening when we buckled on our belts, order was given fall into
line, and our three companies formed in column and marched three miles, where
was a heavy piece of timber. Here we deployed as skirmishers along the fence,
which was built very high, and awaited the rebels until morning. Woods were
on each side of the road. There was nothing worth mentioning occurred to us
during our stay there, but the evening being far advanced, every one was roused
to his feet; some were fast asleep, while others preferred walking up and down to
sleeping, a shot was fired, and then several followed in quick succession. The
sound came from camp. After a volley was fired, everything became silent, and
all was still again, and we returned to camp, when we were informed that they
were ordered out on the top of a high hill, a short time after the three companies
left, and there they remained in line of battle, on the ground, with their
arms by their side; as the night was quite dark, they could not distinguish
friend from foe; they were attacked and had a skirmish, after several volleys
were fired on each side, and three men were badly wounded. If there were
rebels they had all disappeared in the morning. Plenty of tracks were
visible of men and horses near where the firing was, and the supposition was
that there was a considerable force there.</p>

<p>Men were busy all that evening throwing up entrenchments and placing guns
in position, and thus continued night and day for some time.</p>

<p>One evening the order came to prepare for marching. We were soon in line,
the command was given, forward, and off we started. Took the Jackson road
and marched quite close to it, and the command halted to examine the front,
and we were soon ordered forward, the town was quickly surrounded, cannon
placed on both ends of the street, and a sentinel guarded every door and window,
and the citizens when they arose in the morning, found themselves prisoners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>in the hands of the federal soldiers. All the stores were shut. It is a very
good place for a town, and was at one time a smart place for business. There
were several stores and groceries, a saddler's shop, and a fine place for fruit, and
the soldiers fared well for a while on peaches and apples. The merchants would
not sell goods to the Union boys, and they helped themselves. There were but
few men in town, as they left when they heard of our coming, and did not wait
for us to make our appearance, as this was their place of resort a short time
before. After getting what apples and peaches we wanted, and frightening the
citizens by firing several salutes and breaking some windows, we left.</p>

<p>A great many of the citizens of the surrounding country came in to see the
soldiers, and were detained until we left next morning. When the regiment
was ready to return to camp, the report came that General Prentiss was coming
into town with a brigade of infantry, and the regiments were formed in open
order, and at length the expected visitor arrived with his staff. He rode down
through the lines, and back again to the head, and made a short speech to us.
He said never take a word of insult from a rebel; if any one offered you any
insult, shoot him down, for that was the way to end the rebellion. With a few
more remarks, of not much import, he closed his speech, and the column was
soon in motion, and we arrived at quarters early in the evening, much pleased
with our trip.</p>

<p>Then commenced the work of building forts. Spades, shovels and wheelbarrows
came into requisition, and all men fit for duty were compelled to work,
throwing up breastworks until four strong forts were completed and mounted
with heavy siege guns, 24-pounders; the timber was cut down all around within
a mile of the fort. All kinds of reports were flying through camp.</p>

<p>One evening we were ordered to fall in, and without much ceremony some few
companies were marched up through the town, until they reached an old two
story building on the corner of a street. Halt, was heard along the line, and
they stopped for a short time waiting for further orders. They were soon ordered
forward, and marched into the house, up into the first story, and a lookout
was placed at each window. I was one detailed for duty. The night was beautiful,
and I could discern objects for some distance, but nothing disturbed the
quiet of that still evening but the heavy snoring of the soldiers as they lay in
deep sleep all around me. Some, perhaps, were thinking or dreaming of loved
ones at home, of friends that were far away; so the night passed off without an
enemy disturbing us, and in the morning we returned to camp. Several parties
of soldiers were sent out to search for rebels, but they never encountered any,
as they always evaded our scouts.</p>

<p>A man from Perryville, Perry county, came to the Cape asking Bayles to send
a force to meet the rebels said to be advancing on it. About 300 men was ordered
on board the old Illinois steamboat, and company B was chosen and parts
of other companies volunteered to go. After getting on board, the old ark began
to recede from shore. After numerous delays we found ourselves at Sandford's
Landing, fifteen miles from Perryville, and this must be reached as quick
as possible. After ascending a very high hill with the utmost difficulty, we
started on our way. Two citizens took the oath of allegiance on the road, and
were let go where they pleased. Company B was detailed to skirmish through
that broken country, and we were put in advance, and was made to halt if we
got too far ahead, and wait until the rear came up. In the evening company B
was made the advance guard, and they encamped near a large spring of cold
water, which was very acceptable to us, as we did not get much good water after
leaving the river. Here a citizen of Perryville was made a prisoner. He was
lurking near this spring, was well armed, but made no resistance, and he was
soon disarmed. We found him quite an influential man among the citizens, and
was then captain of a rebel company. He was owner of a hotel in town. We
arrived within sight of the town, and were ordered to divide off into small
squads and advance from all sides, and take the town by surprise. The order
was quickly obeyed, and the band struck up the tune of Yankee Doodle, with
drums beating and colors flying, marched into the court yard before the citizens
could get away. There was a German ball in progress, but it was soon stopped
and the people returned to their homes. Whisky flowed quite freely, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>officers and men had a good time generally with the ladies of the town. Beef
was furnished to us by the people, and it was quite a treat to us to get to eat at
a table. There were plenty of apples and peaches, also sweet potatoes, we found
in great abundance. There was plenty to eat here, and the people would invite
the soldiers to dine with them.</p>

<p>Next morning we drew our uniforms, and one of the men by the name of Ford,
was drowned while in the river washing himself before changing his clothes.
This was the first death in the company. A whole brigade followed this young
man to his lonely resting place. The next death was one of Grant's staff, and
the next was a John Headly.</p>

<p>About the middle of October we were ordered to prepare for marching, as we
were to go out to meet Jeff. Thompson's forces, said to be at Fredericksburg.
When we started the rain was falling sufficient to make it pleasant marching,
during the whole of the trip. A brigade of infantry was encamped near the
town, which informed us that Jeff. Thompson had left; so our brigade started
in pursuit, consisting of the 17th Illinois, 5th Indiana cavalry, and one battalion.
We met the rebels and repulsed them after a fight which lasted about twenty-four
hours, which resulted in a loss to the rebels of about 600 in killed, wounded and
prisoners. We came very near being surprised and our force taken. We were
marching as if it were to our destruction, when an old negro warned us of our
danger. He informed Plummer where the rebels were posted. They had planted
two batteries so that when we got close enough they could rake our ranks.
Plummer ordered up a battery and opened on them where we supposed the
rebels were. Blank cartridges were fired from our side, and they replied with
shot and shell, doing no damage, as they shot over us. The 17th Illinois and
part of the 11th Missouri were ordered forward, and they advanced and poured
in a heavy volley of Musketry, and the enemy could not stand it and fled, and
left us masters of the field. The 1st Indiana cavalry made a charge, and Major
Gavitt was killed with 250 men either killed or wounded. Infantry loss was
slight. The 17th and 20th Illinois charged and took a battery. <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Lowe was
killed on the rebel side, and Thompson's army all dispersed. We followed them
12 miles, and they burned a bridge, so we could not follow them any farther.
That was the death-blow to Jeff. Thompson's forces. There were about 3,000
rebels engaged. On our side about 1,700. The battle lasted six hours, and the
rebels were completely routed.</p>

<p>The battle was fought on the 21st day of October, 1861. Nothing worth
mentioning occurred to us until the 25th day of February, 1862, when we were
ordered to prepare for leaving Cape Girardeau, where we had been encamped
for over six months; where we had spent many days on fatigue duty in throwing
up breastworks, and when we left there were four forts, strongly fortified,
mounted with siege guns, and no force the rebels could send against it could
take it, and I think we left it secure from invasion.</p>

<p>On the 26th the regiment got on board the steamer Empress, we landed at
Commerce, and after staying there a short time we took up our line of march
in pursuit of the enemy, said to be retreating from before us. Our advance had
a short skirmish with part of Jeff's forces. Our cavalry routed them, and took
four small cannon, with a few prisoners. The skirmish was a short distance
from Sikestown. Jeff. escaped, but lost his horse and a white feather out of his
hat. The next morning we resumed our march. Rain fell that day, and made
it hard marching for us, and at length we found ourselves opposite New Madrid.
We formed our line of battle and advanced within two miles of the rebel's
stronghold, and they commenced shelling us with their heavy guns, but there was
little damage done our side, and after remaining under fire for some time, we
moved back and bivouacked for the night, as we did not think it advisable to
storm the works then, as the rebels were protected by gunboats, and we could
not hold them if we should gain possession of them. The weather was quite
cold and some snow fell.</p>

<p>After staying here a short time we were ordered to move, and we were soon
in motion again. We marched nearly all night, and at last came to a halt, and
were ordered to lay down without any fire and make ourselves as comfortable as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>possible, and there we remained until morning. Such a night as we passed
there will long be remembered by me. Some of us had no blankets, and we left
our knapsacks at Sikestown. There was some snow on the ground; we waded
through water over our shoes, and had to sleep with wet feet; but very little
sleep we had that long night. We were four miles from a place called Point
Pleasant, and at daylight were on the march for this place. We double-quicked
about two miles. There were a few boats tied up at the landing, which our
sharpshooters soon drove from there, and they all escaped. Some of the crews
were killed.</p>

<p>After Plummer's men drove the rebels from the town, they took possession,
and then commenced the work of plunder. Stores were broken into and everything
of value was taken. One warehouse was filled with corn, sugar and molasses.
Whisky and medicines in abundance, as there were several drug stores,
and the boys helped themselves to what they wanted. Our camp was about a
mile from the town, and most everything of value was carried off. It was in a
low swampy piece of ground, we had no tents, and had to lay on the ground in
water, at times the rain pouring in torrents upon us. A detail was made to go
and dig rifle pits. The enemy had a gunboat, and they tried to drive Captain
Weber and his working party away, but were unable to make the workers desist,
and they soon had sufficient protection from the shot and shell that was continually
falling around them. Batteries were planted, and they got a siege gun in
operation, the enemy's gunboats found it not good policy to venture within reach
of our guns; but they planted batteries on the opposite side of the river, and
then could not make us leave. We had come to stay for a while, and we were
determined on it. New Madrid was soon stormed and taken, and gunboat ran
the blockade, and came down the river puffing and blowing, dismounting all the
enemies batteries and scattering them in every direction, as if they were nothing
but chaff.</p>

<p>After dismounting all the rebel batteries, we were ordered to get ready to
move, and soon were in motion again. Mud was over our shoe tops, and it was
very hard marching. After a while we arrived at New Madrid. I must mention
an occurrence that transpired while at Point Pleasant. One night there was a
heavy thunder shower, accompanied with wind and rain, and a good many trees
were blown down, and several of the 7th Illinois cavalry men killed and
wounded.</p>

<p>One evening a detail of men was made to go and haul a siege gun and plant it
below camp about four miles at a place called Tiptonville. The work was performed
by morning, the boys having hauled it through mud and mire by hand,
and in the morning was ready to go into operation, and that one gun whipped
five boats, and made them get out of reach of its shot, and no boats could pass
there then, so they had to remain above. When we arrived at New Madrid
boats were busy transporting troops across the river, the object being to attack
Island No. 10; but while this was being done they evacuated, and about 4,000
prisoners were taken near Tiptonville. As they were trying to escape a floating
battery came down the river and created quite an excitement amongst the men
until they discovered what it was. Some men boarded with a skiff and found
that there was no danger.</p>

<p>Several steamboats floated down passed our camp, and the rebels tried to sink
them by cutting holes in them, but still they floated down to us, and our men
soon put them in working order. The floating battery sunk near Tiptonville.
We took possession of Island No. 10, and got all the heavy siege guns and an
immense quantity of provisions, plenty of small arms and ammunition. After
remaining at New Madrid for a few days, we took steamboats, steering our course
down the river. <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Pope was in command at this time. Plummer was our
Colonel. We passed several small towns on the way, and arrived at a place
called Mosquito Landing, in Arkansas. It was well worth the name, for a worse
place for mosquitos I never saw. There was no peace for us&mdash;a continual singing
in our ears by these torments.</p>

<p>We were within about three miles of Fort Wright, and our mortars and gunboats
commenced throwing shot and shell into the rebel works. We could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>plainly see the smoke and hear the report of our guns as they exploded. After
remaining here for a short time we were ordered back up river to opposite
Hamburg Landing, where we disembarked, and took up our line of march towards
Corinth, where the rebels were making a stand to dispute our progress
into the State of Mississippi. Our advance had a fight almost every day, but
they drove the rebels before them at every skirmish. They could make but
a poor resistance to our advance, and we gained very rapidly on the rebels, and
drove them back step by step, until they arrived within about four miles of
Corinth. Here a long line of rifle pits were dug, and heavy siege pieces were
got into position. We encamped within about six miles of Corinth, and had
our grand guard line established to within about three miles of Corinth. Pickets
were shooting at one another most of the time, until the 8th of May, 1862, when
a brigade of Infantry and some cavalry were ordered out to reconnoitre, when
the rebels were drove inside their works. After the day had drawn to a close,
and the dew was falling heavily, we retraced our steps, and rested for the night
a short distance from Farmington.</p>

<p>Early the next morning our ears were saluted with the heavy boom of cannon.
The rebels had planted several batteries during the night, and the 22d and 50th
Illinois had barely time to throw off their knapsacks, for the rebels were pouring
the shot and shell into them, and they had to take the cover of a heavy
piece of timber. The rebels tried to dislodge them, but were unable to do so.
The brigade was ordered to take a position on the left, and it was done as soon
as possible. We could see the rebels as they charged in heavy masses on our
men. They advanced with a yell and a rush, but were obliged to fall back from
the heavy fire of our men, who were pouring heavy volleys of musketry into
their columns. As their regiments were thrown into confusion the 2d Iowa cavalry
made a charge, and drove the rebels back, but there were too many of them
and they had to fall back with heavy loss. Their was but little artillery used on
our side, as the object was not to bring on a general engagement. It was on this
day that the Lieut. Colonel of the 47th Illinois was killed. He was very well
liked by the regiment, and they suffered a great loss in his death.</p>

<p>The 11th Missouri regiment was formed in line of battle within a short distance
of a rebel battery which was shelling our men with pretty good effect, but
they never fired a shot at us. Their object was to flank us and take all prisoners.
Our Colonel at this time was Joseph A. Mowers. Plummer was promoted
to a Brigadier General, and he recommended Mower for our Colonel, and he was
accepted by the regiment as a fit man to command it. He was riding up and
down the lines surveying with an eagle eye the operations of the enemy, when
he perceived their intention was to flank us, and he ordered us to about face in
retreat, and we double-quicked about two miles, came to a halt, and formed our
line, waiting to receive the rebels if they made their appearance. But they did
not think it advisable to venture into the timber where we were posted. We
remained there until evening, and then returned to camp. An advance was
made along our whole line, and that night we planted several batteries, and next
day dug rifle pits at Farmington. Our line of rifle pits extended along the whole
line, a distance of fourteen miles. Two companies had to lay in the pits in case
of an attack, but we were not molested.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May five companies of the 11th Missouri and some artillery
were ordered out to drive in the rebel grand guard, and our gunners shelled the
rebel camp awhile. They had to leave and go inside their works; we made a
charge, and the rebels fled before us about half a mile. Companies H and F
were thrown out as skirmishers. We passed through some heavy timber, and
when we came out into view the rebels poured a heavy volley into us, but
it passed over our heads and done us no injury. Company H was skirmishing in
advance a short distance, when three of them were wounded, the whole regiment
was ordered to fire. We fired one round and the rebels fell back. One man
came in and give himself up. But few prisoners were taken. One rebel was
carried from the field by our men, and he died before they could get him to the
hospital.</p>

<p>Our General did not think it good policy to venture too close at this time,
so we returned to camp.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>It was in front of Corinth that <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Worthington was killed. He was doing
duty on guard, and the orders were very strict. The sentinels were ordered to
allow no one outside of the lines after night. He gave the order himself, and
that night he was killed by one of his own men. He belonged to the 5th Iowa
infantry.</p>

<p>On the 28th another advance was made, and this day company B lay in between
the fire of two batteries&mdash;ours and the rebels'&mdash;for two hours, as they
had to fire right over them. They had skirmished to within 200 yards of the
rebel works, and there they were ordered to lay down, and the shot and shell
flew all around them, but not a man of company B was injured. A long line of
rifle pits were dug and our men soon had protection from the enemy's shot and
shell, as they were doing their best to drive them back, they held their position
and could not get the federals to leave. They made several charges on our batteries,
but were repulsed at every point, and were obliged to retire and leave us
masters of the field. We lay in the pits all of the 29th, and on this night the
rebels evacuated.</p>

<p>The attack was to be made along the whole line on the 30th. Everything
being ready, the ball was to be opened on the morrow by Gens. Halleck and
Pope, when the rebels evacuated, and we took possession. Our ears were
startled by hearing a sound like the report of a hundred cannon being fired at
once. It was the rebels blowing up their magazine before leaving. Our men
took possession on the morning of the 30th, and started in pursuit of the retreating
rebels. We followed them about twenty-five miles, to a place called Booneville.
About 20,000 prisoners were taken altogether.</p>

<p><abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Ellett, with a strong force of cavalry intercepted the cars at Booneville
with about 2,000 men on board, and an immense amount of arms and ammunition,
which was burned and the railroad destroyed.</p>

<p>When the rebel magazine was burning a heavy smoke arose, and the sky was
dark with dense columns of smoke as it curled upwards from the burning timbers,
and at last came the explosion. We thought that our men had made the
attack&mdash;but no, the birds had flown, and left us nothing but their cage.</p>

<p>After remaining at Booneville several days, we returned to Corinth, and took
our camp on Clear Creek, about four miles from that place. There we formed
a camp of instruction. It was a very hard march from Booneville to our present
camp. Our brigade was commanded by the Colonel of the 8th Wisconsin
regiment of volunteers. Our Colonel drilled us in the battalion drill in the
morning, brigade drill in the afternoon. We had our drills for several weeks.</p>

<p>At last we received marching orders, and all was bustle until we were on the
move again. We marched from Clear Creek to Burnville, and from Burnville,
we went to Iuka, where there are several fine springs of water, and was, in times
of peace, a great resort for the aristocracy of the South, to spend their summer.
From there we went to Tuscumbia, where we remained for some time. Tuscumbia
was a flourishing town a short distance from the Tennessee River. Our gunboats
threw a few shell into it and raised quite an excitement in town. There
was no business carried on, only by a few sutlers. There was a fine spring and
we had plenty of water, apples and peaches in great abundance; also sweet potatoes
and corn. The negroes brought into camp watermelons, and we had a
good supply of them for some time.</p>

<p>From here we were ordered back to Iuka, having received information that a
force of rebel cavalry was in Russelville. We took up our line of march with
two pieces of artillery, to go into the mountains in search of these marauders.
We traveled all over the hills of Tuscumbia, but did not encounter an enemy, as
the 3d Michigan cavalry met them and defeated them before we could get to
their assistance, near Russelville. We passed through Russelville and Frankfort,
and here rebel cavalry cut off some of our stragglers, and two were taken
prisoners. At length we arrived at Iuka. After remaining there a short time
we moved out about eight miles from there and throwed up breastworks. Several
of the boys were out about one mile from the camp gathering watermelons,
and six of them were taken prisoners. Our men went out in pursuit but they
fled before them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<p>One evening six companies of the 11th Missouri went out to reconnoitre, and
went out ten miles when we got intimation that the rebels were in strong force
in our front, and came to a halt, and were ordered to lay down and rest our
weary limbs. We remained here until about two o'clock, when we were ordered
back to camp, where we arrived at day-light and found everything ready to move.
When we returned we encamped at Burnville one night, and next day we returned
to Camp Clear Creek, and we did not get rested before we were ordered
back again to Burnville. We marched all night and at length we arrived again
at Burnville, where we encamped for the night. Next day the 8th Wisconsin,
11th Missouri, 16th Iowa, and a battery of artillery and a battalion of cavalry,
Berges' sharpshooters, acted as skirmishers, going in advance. We arrived to
within about two miles of Iuka, we formed our line of battle and the command
was given forward, guide centre, and the 11th moved forward, Colonel Mower at
their head. He was in command of the expedition. We advanced to within a
mile of Iuka. They disputed our advance, but we steadily moved on. Several
shots were fired at the rebel cavalry, but they did not offer us battle, they did
not know our numbers. After maneuvering around for several hours we started
back, as we supposed, to Burnville, and got about two miles when we were
ordered back again, to attack the pursuing rebels who intended to cut us off, but
in this they were foiled by the Generalship of <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Joseph A. Mower, and we
drove the rebels into their stronghold. We could hear their bugle sound quite
distinctly, and their intention was to send a force of cavalry and cut us off from
Burnville. They burned a train of cars, killed several of our cavalry and tore
up the road, but did not venture into Burnville. After going quite close to Iuka
we retraced our steps, and after kindling numerous fires to deceive the enemy,
we left, and they supposed that we were encamped close to them, and great
must have been their chagrine and mortification when they surrounded the fires
in the morning, to find the bird had flown. After building the fires we returned
to camp at Boonville without molestation, where we stayed all of one day and
next day until in the afternoon, when we were ordered to march again, and that
night we encamped a short distance from Jacinto. It was here that we first saw
Rosecrans. He had taken command of our division.</p>

<p>We were on the move again early next morning, and came to a halt at our old
camping ground, about eight miles from Iuka, where we got our dinner. Skirmishing
commenced with the enemy's pickets here, and two of our cavalry were
killed at a white house a mile from our camp. The property was owned by a
widow woman, and was burned by the infantry. We skirmished with the rebels
to within two miles of Iuka, where we came to a halt, and what was it broke the
stillness of this pleasant afternoon, the 19th of September, 1862? It was the
heavy roar of cannon and musketry. The rebels occupied a strong position in
front of Iuka, the 5th Iowa infantry was attacked by the rebels, as they were a
support to the 11th Ohio battery; the rebels charged upon them and in spite of
the heavy fire of artillery and musketry they drove our men from their guns and
took possession of them. The 5th contested the ground bravely, as their thinned
ranks could testify. Their loss was about two hundred killed and wounded.
About this time our brigade came up and our regiment was ordered to the front.
We formed in four columns. After loading our guns we marched to the regiment
in double-quick; distant from a piece of timber about half a mile, and here
we right-flanked and marched in line of battle until we gained the cover of the
timber, and a heavy growth of underbrush. The rebels were advancing to meet
us, and said they were our friends and begged us not to fire on them, and we labored
under this mistake for some time, but company C, commanded by <abbr title="Captain">Capt.</abbr>
Warner, being in advance of the regiment, saw the rebels coming and charged
bayonets, and took eleven prisoners, including a Lieutenant. They were sent to
the rear. The rebels approached so close that they used their revolvers, as the
smoke of powder made it quite dark where we were, they did no damage but
scorched some of the boys' faces with the powder. When we discovered the
rebels in such close proximity to us we were ordered to fire, which order was
obeyed with alacrity, and volley after volley was poured into their advancing
columns. They throwed column after column against our lines to break them
and cut their way out, but were unable to break our ranks. They tried three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>times and were as often driven back, as our fire was undiminished until our ammunition
was expended, when we were ordered to fall back. After enduring the
fire of the enemy for an hour and a half we fell back, by order of commander,
and the 10th Missouri took our place. During this time our men charged the
rebels and retook our battery and two more guns. We lay on our arms all night;
after getting ammunition and filling our cartridge-boxes we laid down to get
some rest for our weary limbs; having no blankets, and as the air became quite
cold, we had to keep ourselves in motion to keep from freezing. Our shirts were
wet from the sweat, and when we laid down we expected every moment to renew
the attack. A heavy volley was fired and every man sprung to his gun, but
as there was no more firing we lay down again and tried to get some sleep, but
that was out of the question, the air was too cold for that. That night General
Price left. The attack was to have been made next morning, and an order to
that effect was sent to General Rosecrans from Grant, but it was intercepted.&mdash;We
were sent by the way of Jacinto, and General Grant had to go straight to
Iuka, which was not half as far as we had to go, and if it were not for that accident
General Price, with all of his force, would have been captured; as it was,
they discovered we were too strong for them, and thought it the best policy to
get away as soon as possible; so that night they left and next morning we started
in pursuit. General Grant threw out his skirmishers and made his advance
into the town, but they soon found the rebels had fled, and they went into town
with their colors flying. When we passed through the town almost every house
was filled with sick or wounded soldiers, which they left behind in their haste to
get away. We followed them all day but they had too much the start of us, and
at night we encamped, and in the morning were on our way back again. After
marching night and day we arrived at Jacinto, where we rested for a short time;
but we did not remain here long. We were soon ordered to move again, as there
was not much rest for us. From Jacinto we went to Rienzi, and there encamped
for some time, and got pretty well rested.</p>

<p>One evening when we were thinking of laying down and having a good night's
sleep, we were ordered to prepare for marching, so, early in the evening we got
started, and after marching until the night was far advanced, the command was
ordered to halt, and here we remained until next morning. There we made our
coffee and got plenty of good apples. After getting our breakfast we started
again and came to a halt at the Hatchie River, where we remained until nearly
night, when we were ordered to fall in and were soon on our way back. After
following this road for some time we turned to the left, in the direction of
Corinth. We marched all night until we came to a place called Cossouth, near
which place we encamped one night, and next morning started again, and went
within a mile of Corinth, and were ordered to meet the advancing enemy, who
were said to be driving our men before them. We came to a halt, stacked our
arms and supposed we were to have a rest, when the order in stern command
came along our lines to fall in. We suffered greatly for want of water. We
marched in quick time and could hear the heavy roar of cannon as we advanced.
All at once we came to a halt, and formed our line of battle. What was it that
made it so still? all at once everything seemed quiet. It was a calm before an
approaching storm, for the rebels were advancing in solid column, and poured a
heavy volley of musketry into our ranks, and one hundred of the 8th Wisconsin
was either killed or wounded. Our loss was slight, one noble young man in
company B, was killed. He was shot in the head and died without a struggle;
and we had to leave him on the field. They shot at us at long range, but some of
their skirmishers advanced quite close to us, and some of the 11th went out to
meet them, and the firing was quite brisk for some time. The rebels did not
advance any farther at this time. They got a cross fire on the 8th Wisconsin,
and they suffered most in the brigade. The rebels had the advantage of position
and numbers. Their intention was to outflank us but they were unable to
do so, as we could fall back under the heavy siege guns, commanded by McWilliams.
After holding the rebels in check for some time we fell back, the 11th
went inside of Fort Robinette and there lay down, and made ourselves as comfortable
as possible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>
<p>About two o'clock in the morning, the boys having built a number of fires
along the line, the rebels advanced a battery to within five hundred yards of us
and commenced shelling with grape and canister. The order was given to put
out the fires, as the rebels were getting the range of us pretty well, and we had
to lay close to the ground for fear of being hit. Several guns were injured as
they stood in the stacks, and one of company A, was slightly injured. One man
in the 27th Ohio was killed by the bursting of a shell, as the whole Ohio brigade
lay right in front of us and we were behind them as support. They shelled
us and most every shot went over us, and went crashing through the town, a
building being a poor protection from balls. Some of them wasted their strength
against the trees in the timber, whilst others exploded above us, and we could
hear the grape shot as it fell all around us. It was singular that no more were
injured as two brigades lay inside the works of Fort Robinette. Our gunners
replied at intervals, until at length day began to dawn, when our artillerists
could see where to direct their fire, and they soon stopped the rebels' guns.&mdash;They
killed most all the rebels' horses and one gun was taken as a prize, and
the Captain taken prisoner. There was eight brass field pieces, and it was almost
impossible to get away with their battery. After the rebels' battery was
silenced everything became silent except the occasional shot from the rebel
sharpshooters. Their bullets would whistle over us and sometimes strike an officer
or private and wound him, but not dangerously, as they were at too great
a range to do us much damage, the strength of the balls being spent before
they reached us. Sleep did not visit General Rosecrans that night. He was
busy planning and placing batteries in position to give the rebels a warm reception
if they made their appearance, as it was their intention to make a desperate
effort to recover Corinth and drive Rosecrans out, and he was planning how he
could best draw them on so he could bring all his guns to bear upon them. We
were laying down in the rear of the Ohio brigade as a support to them, and the
rebels could use no artillery upon us as they could not get a suitable position to
use it. The timber was all cut down in front of us for a quarter of a mile, and
the rebels had taken possession of a heavy piece of timber in our front, but on
the right of us was an open space of ground where we had a battery planted.&mdash;Some
of the rebel sharpshooters stationed themselves in trees, the better to see
our skirmishers and pick them off. Our men soon discovered where they were,
and many a rebel paid the penalty of climbing a tree, being picked off by our
sharpshooters. Several were shot out of the tops of trees by the cannon. Our
batteries were so fixed that they could rake any part of the field, our artillerists
kept up a continual fire from their heavy siege pieces shelling the woods where
the rebels in strong force were supposed to be preparing to attack us. At
length we saw the long lines of the rebels advancing upon us. <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Mowers selected
two companies of the 11th Missouri to act as skirmishers. Mowers was
riding a very fretful horse when he started out, he having his beloved Rock shot
under him the day before, a horse that had carried him many a mile and never
appeared tired, and that horse would go without flinching wherever his master
required him, but he was killed at last, and he had to take another horse.&mdash;When
we saw him riding at the head of the skirmishers we thought he would
be killed or taken prisoner. He galloped on regardless of the many bullets
aimed at him, until he was wounded and taken prisoner, but he gave warning to
his men and they went back inside the fort, and the rebels came on in solid column.
As they emerged from the woods their colors were thrown to the breeze
and proudly waved o'er these sons of the South. They steadily advanced to
take a battery on our right, and our men were waiting in line of battle to receive
them. There was nothing to cover them, and volley after volley of musketry
was poured into their advancing columns. As one man fell another took his
place, and still they went on, tiring as they went, reached the battery, drove our
men from their guns and turned them on our men. But they did not enjoy their
triumph long, for a shell from a 64-pounder exploded right amongst them, spread
death and destruction all around when they were thrown into confusion, our
men rallied and drove them from the guns at the point of the bayonet. Some
of the rebels went into town and began to plunder everything they could lay
their hands upon. Three were killed in the Provost Marshal's office. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>here that the 5th Minnesota did good service. Many a rebel was made to bite
the dust from the deadly aim of the 5th Minnesota rifles, and they were at
length compelled to yield and fly before the impetuous valor of our men. All
this passed much quicker than I can write.</p>

<p>How was it with the rebels? They were creeping upon us like snakes in the
grass, firing as they came, led on by the brave <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Rogers, of the 2d Texas
cavalry. The 63d Ohio, also the 27th, was doing its best to keep them back, but
still they came on and planted their colors on the fort, when the 11th was ordered
to charge. They rose and fired a volley into their ranks and charged bayonets,
but the rebels could not stand the cold steel. They broke and fled in all
directions. <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Rogers was ordered to surrender as prisoner of war, but he
would not, but kept shooting with his revolver and giving command to his men,
when one of the regulars shot him in the side with a revolver, and one of company
B shot him through the breast. He reeled from his horse and fell to the
ground within a short distance of the outer edge of the ditch. Several other
officers were killed and lay close to him. A horse was laying dead and a man
by his side; another laid a little in the rear; he had been struck by a shell in
the head, and lay with his hand grasping some hair and brains; his head was
nothing but a shell, the brains were scattered all over the ground. But few ever
reached the woods that made the charge, and their loss must have been terrible.
A good many came in and gave themselves up, as it was dangerous business to
attempt reaching the timber. They would start up every little while from where
they lay concealed, but few could escape our bullets. Many would rise up and
cry for quarters; these would come in and be sent to the rear as prisoners. You
can judge for yourself how bloody now was the conflict here and along the
whole line. Twenty-five dead lay in the ditch, and we had to remove them in
order to take their place, so that if the rebels returned we would be prepared
for them, as we had gathered up the rebels' guns, we were well supplied. Two
of the boys had fifteen guns, and most of them had two.</p>

<p>The battle was over by 12 o'clock. Our loss was slight compared to the
enemy's. Their loss was about 4,000 killed, wounded and prisoners. Whole
ranks were cut down by the cannon shot, every gun that could be brought to
bare was used; the rebels could not stand such a decimating fire, they broke and
fled in confusion. We laid in the ditches all night waiting the rebels' return,
but they never made their appearance.</p>

<p>After the battle was over General Rosecrans came through the lines, and was
cheered most heartily, as he had proved himself more than a match for Price
and his staff. Defeated 40,000 rebel troops under Price with half that number,
and gained a decisive victory over them.</p>

<p>While they were engaging us <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Hurlbut was marching with a strong force
to get in the rear of the rebels, and they met at the Hatchie river, where a
severe engagement ensued, and our men were victorious, drove them back, and
we marched to intercept them. As we started in pursuit on the 5th, they were
turned back and had to retrace their steps until they came to another crossing
that was not occupied by federals. The rout became general, and all along the
whole road was strewn guns, tents, &amp;c. Caissons and cannon were captured,
wagon loads of ammunition and wagons of every description. Flour was scattered
all along the road, and cooking utensils of all kinds in their haste to get
away; our men were close upon them all the time. They would turn and give
battle, and then retreat, as our men would overtake them as they would get a
pretty good start of them again. Almost every house contained either dead or
sick soldiers. Stragglers became plenty, and came in by dozens, as the woods
were full of them. They were paroled. The 2d brigade followed them to
Ripley. The 11th went to within a short distance of Ripley and came to a halt,
and stacked arms in a piece of timber, expecting to remain for some time.
Some of the 11th were detailed as grand guard, company B being part of the
detail, we went out in advance and deployed out the same as skirmishers, between
a cornfield and a swamp. We stood on guard about two hours when we
received orders to return to camp. On our return we were informed that we
would remain here until evening, when we would go out and establish a grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>guard line. At length we started through almost impassable roads, sometimes
nothing but a path to guide us. Where we established our line was an old
wheat field, and it was the intention of our commanders to cover our whole line
with a strong guard; and here we supposed we would remain until next day.
But no, there was no such good fortune awaiting us, as the order came for us to
return to the regiment, as we were to march that night. We returned to camp
again, and were informed that we were to march at 2 o'clock that night. We
had sweet potatoes and fresh meat in great plenty, and after eating a good meal
we lay down, and were roused from our slumbers by hearing the command to
fall in. As we were rear guard to the wagon train, we were the last to get
started. Such a march as that was; it was enough to wear out any man's
patience. We had to stop every five minutes for the train to proceed. Some of
the teams would refuse to pull, and this would stop the whole train. We lingered
along this way all night; our progress being very slow and tedious; so
next day we went ahead of the train, and did not stop much until we arrived at
Corinth, where we established a camp about one mile from the town, and here
we remained for some time, had our brigade and battalion drills under Colonel
Loomis, of the 26th Illinois, who was acting as brigadier at this time. Every
regiment was ordered to report with spade and shovel for fatigue duty, and we
had to work from day to day until we considered Corinth impregnable, as there
were strong earthworks all around the city. Most of the inhabitants had left,
and the town was occupied by soldiers. After completing this work we received
orders to prepare to march with two day's rations in our haversacks, also knapsacks
with blankets. After every thing was got ready, the command was given
along the whole line, and off they moved, one regiment after another. At
length came a long line of wagons, extending as far as the eye could reach, and
a strong guard was left to guard these trains. So we moved on from day to day,
sometimes marching all night. We were not disturbed by an enemy, but the
advance skirmished almost every day with the rebels, and at length the rebels
were driven back to the Tallahatchie river, where they were in strong position,
and had thrown up strong earthworks, and here they would have given us a
warm reception if Sherman had not marched with a strong force to get in their
rear. We could hear the heavy roar of artillery as our men advanced to the
attack, as we had just reached the place where the brigade was establishing
camp. Being rear guard we did not arrive at camp until 2 o'clock in the morning.
Rations were distributed to us, and we lay down on our blankets and were
soon fast asleep. We awoke much refreshed after our tedious march of the day
before. Next morning we went about a mile from here, and pitched our tents,
and remained several days. There was a grist mill near here, and the soldiers
used it and ground corn as long as we remained. There was some ammunition
captured here. A very good spring of water was near our camp, which was a
rare thing to us.</p>

<p>The rebels did not wait long enough to see what Sherman's intentions were,
but as soon as they got an intimation that there was a force to get in their rear,
they left their stronghold and fled, but Sherman took a good many prisoners,
and pursued them for some time. The rebels did not halt until they reached
Grenada. After remaining several days here we moved to Cold Water, and remained
a short time. There was a small town on the railroad. The next place
we went to was Oxford, Mississippi, where we went into camp and remained for
some time.</p>

<p>Here the report came into camp that the rebels had made a raid on Holly
Springs, and taken all the soldiers stationed there prisoners and paroled them,
also the commander of the post. Three weeks' provisions for Grant's whole
army and an immense quantity of army clothing, several thousand pairs of cavalry
boots were also captured, and an immense amount of cotton was burned,
together with a train of cars just ready to start out. The raid was made by
Van Dorn and about 7,000 mounted infantry, at the break of day. Report says
that Murphy had knowledge of the intended raid on Holly Springs, but of that
we have no certain information, but he did not prove himself true to the Government
at first, as he was entrusted with removing all the commissary stores
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>along the railroad from Corinth to Tuscumbia, as the rebels were said to be advancing
in force. Tuscumbia valley is a very fine country, with an abundance
of corn for forage for their cavalry.</p>

<p>Their advance soon arrived at Tuscumbia and took possession. Everything
was removed to Corinth, and their cavalry followed the valley right up to Iuka,
surrounded the pickets and took them prisoners. The 8th Wisconsin was scattered
all over town, and there were few to resist the attack of the rebels. They
returned to camp as soon as possible, but a large number were taken prisoners.
Everything that could not be removed was ordered to be destroyed, and it was
entrusted to an officer in the 7th Illinois cavalry to do the burning, but for
some reason it was neglected, and an immense quantity of flour and commissary
stores, which came very acceptable to them, fell into their hands. There were
several sutler stores there, and the cavalry took almost everything, clothing,
tobacco, and some good liquors. You may ask, where was Murphy all this
time? He was retreating with his regiment towards Burnville. The rebels
pursued them several miles, as there were a great many negroes following the
regiment, the rebels would come up and shoot them down without mercy. After
traveling several miles the rebels gave up the pursuit. Murphy was put under
arrest for this and tried by court martial, but for some reason got clear, and was
restored to confidence again, and entrusted with the post at Holly Springs, but
abusing the confidence reposed in him, he was arrested, tried again, cashiered,
and dishonorably discharged the service without any pay.</p>

<p>That stopped our forward movement, and we were ordered back to Corinth.
We returned to Davis' Mills, where part of the 25th Indiana had a desperate
engagement with the raiders, as it was their intention to surprise the guard and
take them prisoners, but in this they failed in every attempt. A great many of
them were killed and wounded. Their intention was to burn the mills and
tear up the railroad here, and stop the cars from running, but <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Morgan
with his little band resisted all their attacks, as he was in a strong position near
the mill. Earthworks were thrown up and our men were on the inside; some
cotton bales were placed around the top as a protection to sharpshooters. Some
of the men defended themselves from the mill, several were shot and fell in the
water as they were attempting to cross over. After trying in vain to dislodge
the federals, they gave it up and left without doing the Indiana boys any damage.
But this was not the only place they visited. They went to Bolivar, Tennessee,
and there met with as warm a reception as they got at the mills, and they very
soon left, leaving some of their number either killed, wounded or prisoners, in
the hands of our men. They tried several places along the railroad from Holly
Springs, but met with no better success, as the guards were on the alert. They
attacked a small force belonging to the 12th Michigan, numbering 115 men, in a
small fort, and Van Dorn demanded their surrender, they refused, and informed
him if he wanted them he must take them, while we were getting a warm meal
they would get a cold bite. Alter receiving this answer to his demand, he made
ready for the attack; 500 of the men dismounted and advanced from all sides
to surround this little band of brave men; on they came, expecting an easy prize,
they approached to within a short distance of the fort when the order was given
to fire, and the rebels were met by a shower of bullets, and after trying in vain
to get inside of the fort, they left and took their wounded with them, leaving
about 30 dead around the fort. There was no artillery used on either side.</p>

<p>Such was the success of Van Dorn's raid along the railroad, they cut a few
telegraph poles, and the wire in one or two places, and had to leave suddenly as
our cavalry had got on their track and were but a short distance behind them,
when they left the 12th Michigan infantry. Only one man of the brave little
garrison lost his life, and that was by the accidental discharge of his gun. Our
cavalry soon drove them inside of their lines, and here we will leave them for
awhile.</p>

<p>You will return with me to camp again and leave the pursuit of the rebels.
Our camp is situated on a rise of ground 100 yards from water, either way, and
we did not suffer for that article while we remained there, which was several
weeks. Grant's army had to subsist on the citizens of the country; army stores
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>were quite scarce, and it became the duty of our Generals to look out for the
welfare of their men, and long trains of wagons were sent with orders to take a
certain amount of forage, when it arrived in camp it was distributed to each regiment.
This forage consisted of fresh pork, newly packed coffee, sugar, molasses,
cattle and hogs were also drove into camp, and we fared pretty well, as
there were plenty of provisions in the country. We had plenty of everything
but bread. One cracker was allowed us a day. Several thousand army overcoats
were discovered concealed in a cellar, and the coffee we got belonged to
us. It was stolen at the time of the raid, as the citizens participated in it.</p>

<p>They said they had just received it from Memphis, but our men were not to be
deceived by such stories, and would take most all of it from them. Some of
them had protection papers but this did not save them, as the soldiers had got
tired of listening to such professions of Unionism and loyalty as these men
made, which was only in vain, as there was but little friendship for the Yankees
existing amongst them at this time. We lived on the country for more than two
weeks. Everything was taken for miles from camp, and on New-Year's day we
were ordered to prepare for marching, taking nothing but two day's rations in
our haversacks, and blankets and arms, with forty rounds of ammunition in our
cartridge boxes. We ascertained our destination was La Grange. The rebels
were expected to make a dash on that place. We arrived in sight of the town
about the middle of the afternoon, came to a halt, and remained until nearly evening,
when we received orders to return to camp, and were soon treading our
way back, as there was no use for us here. We arrived at camp early in the
evening, broke ranks and went to our respective tents. As they were made to
hold four men each, we lay down and soon were fast asleep. So passed the first
day of 1863. But we were not destined to remain here much longer, as we received
marching orders to return to Corinth, as a brigade came to take our place
from Holly Springs, and they informed us that Oxford was destroyed by fire, also
Holly Springs, in retaliation for shooting of our soldiers by the citizens of
the town at the time of the raid. It was here that <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Mowers returned to the
regiment, having recovered from the wound which he received before being taken
a prisoner by the rebels. He was taken back to their lines, and as he had
nothing on him to denote his rank, dressed in a common blouse without any
shoulder straps, he was not very closely guarded, and he managed to escape the
same day by mounting one of the rebels horses and riding it into camp, or into
the lines, as we had no camp at this time. He was cheered by the whole brigade
as he rode through the lines without any hat. His wound was quite severe
and he had to go to the hospital to receive proper attendance and care, and there
he remained until he came here ready to take command of his regiment. General
call was sounded and we were ordered to prepare for marching. The tents
were soon struck and rolled up and loaded on the wagons, everything being ready
we strapped on our knapsacks, fell into line waiting for the command forward,
which at last we received, and are again on the tramp.</p>

<p>On our march to Corinth, by the way of Bolivar, we passed through several
towns, La Grange and Grand Junction, near where the 11th was a guard for ten
days, as they were moving towards Holly Springs. Our rations were scarce
here as we drew nothing but flour, and as we had no means of cooking it we
might as well have had none. We were well supplied with fresh meat as we
found plenty of fat hogs in the country which we killed. We managed to get
some of the flour baked by the negroes.</p>

<p>At length the order came for us to move, and we were glad to leave here, and
then we went to Oxford from there. Grand Junction was a railroad station
where two roads crossed, between Holly Springs and Corinth. We left it to
our right and took the road to Bolivar, where we halted for the night, and the
next morning was pleasant, and remained so until we arrived at Bolivar, when
the rain commenced falling in torrents upon us, and it became very difficult to
march. It rained without intermission most all night, and the brigade was urged
forward until at length the men refused to proceed any farther, and fell out
of ranks and commenced building fires.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>There we remained until morning. The roads had become almost impassable.
Teams had as much as they wanted to do to haul their loads. The rain ceased
towards morning and the sun came out and the roads commenced drying as we
proceeded.</p>

<p>After days of wearied marching we arrived at Corinth. That evening rain
commenced falling, from rain it turned to snow, and after freezing the ground
was covered with a crust of ice. After remaining here a few days when we had
received our two months' pay, the regiment was ordered to strike tents and get
ready for marching. Everything being packed the regiment was ordered to fall
in, the rain was coming quite steady, and we arrived at Corinth wet through.&mdash;After
waiting a short time the snow and ice was fast disappearing from the
ground, it had all left the hills. When part of the 11th Missouri went on board,
the iron horse began to puff and blow her steam from her pipes, the cars were
soon in motion, and Corinth was soon left far behind. We passed through several
small towns on our way, stopped at Jackson, Tennessee, for a short time,
and was soon on our way again until we arrived at what was once a small town
called Germantown, where we remained all night. Some of the boys found
quarters in some old deserted buildings, but I chose to stay on the cars as the
night was very dark and muddy. I slept soundly until morning. I arose, got
off the cars and made me some coffee, and after eating my breakfast took a
stroll through the town. It is not much of a town, about fifteen miles from
Memphis, on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad.</p>

<p>The brigade remained several weeks here to guard the Memphis and Charleston
Railroad. After we established camp the rest of the regiment came, and
guards were stationed all around the camp as protection, and there was another
line out near a mile. In time of peace this place was a great resort for sporting
men from Memphis, but there was nothing but a few old houses now, and
most of them deserted. Some people were living there then, but most of the
men were in the rebel army, and most all of the corn was taken for forage, and
there was very little of anything left for the people to subsist on. Hogs were
killed until there were scarcely any left, all the fences were burned for fuel, every
board that could be found was used to make bunks. Water was plenty and
of good quality. The weather became quite pleasant and the roads soon dried
up, and we had our daily battalion drill, and spade and shovel came again into
requisition, and men were detailed to go and build a fort, as it was considered
necessary. After working from day to day with the assistance of the 8th Wisconsin
regiment, there was a fort built and a battery planted on the inside. The
battery was manned by the 2d Iowa artillerists. After finishing this fort we
were ordered to prepare for marching. It was shortly after moving our camp.
We had the tent called the Cybley tent, and we could put fire in them and make
them quite comfortable, as there was an aperture for the smoke to go out.&mdash;There
was room enough for fifteen men in one of these tents. They were placed
up about three feet from the ground and banked up with earth all around, and
a door was made for an entrance.</p>

<p>At last our brigade was ordered to move, and we had to pull down our tents
and leave our comfortable quarters and try the field again. The brigade moved
to within two miles of Memphis, and there they encamped for the night, and
men were detailed to go and load the boats, and passed one day loading the
boats. The brigade marched down to the landing and were soon on board, as
most everything was on board. Each regiment loaded their own things and it
was done in short order, and the 11th Missouri was soon ready to go down the
river. At last the boat got under way and stopped at Helena for a short time.
General Prentiss was commander of this post at this time. Several of the boys
got off the boat and got a little the worse of liquor and became quite noisy, and
General Prentiss ordered his men to arrest them, but they were unable to do so,
owing to the resistence made. Revolvers were drawn and missiles were thrown,
and the guard was driven from the ground, and they soon returned with reinforcements,
and Mowers went on shore to get the men to go on board their boats,
and they soon went on board. The guards formed in line in front of the boats
and loaded their guns. Chunks of coal were showered upon them and several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>of the officers and men were hit. General Prentiss came to give some orders to
his men when he was struck in the head, and this so enraged him that he sent
for a brigade of infantry and a battery of artillery, and they were coming on
double-quick when the boats moved out for fear of a general outbreak, as there
was one of the 47th Illinois shot through his leg, and when the sergeant shot he
ran, pursued by several of the 47th, but I never learned the particulars as the
pursuers had not returned when the boat left. We crossed the river and the
boat was tied up to the shore and the regiment got off and then commenced the
work of preparing our meals. We landed on a small island, there was plenty
of wood for fuel and soon numerous fires were kindled and the work of cooking
was soon over, and our meal was ready for eating, which was coffee, fried bacon
and crackers, that constituted our bill-of-fare, also sugar to sweeten our coffee.
After remaining here several hours the bell rang, and we were ordered on board,
the boat was loosed from her mooring and we left this place and went down the
river about six miles, and stopped and remained all night on the boats, and in
the morning the brigade went on shore. Then commenced the work of clearing
ground for a camp. The cane stood thick on the ground and all this was cut
down and carried into piles to be burned. Here we got new tents, and there
was a place soon cleared off to put them up. The tents were made to hold four
men, and there was but little room, as the water was all around us; there was
nothing but sand after the cane was carried off. The division was all camped
here commanded by General Tuttle, and Joseph A. Mowers commanded the
brigade. He received his promotion a short time before. The division remained
here for nearly a month awaiting a boat to carry us away. At length the boats
arrived, and we were glad to see the tall smoke stacks appear in sight, as we
knew that we would soon leave this dull place. We were ordered on board the
boats, and under a heavy fall of rain we struck our tents and stayed all night
and next day until about four o'clock. The wind was blowing a very strong
breeze, the rain had ceased and the weather became cool enough for overcoats.
At length, after many hours impatient waiting, the boats got under way, and
nothing occurred worthy of notice until we arrived at a place called Duckport,
and there the division landed, and then commenced the work of unloading the
boats. Provisions and army stores were soon carried from the boat on shore,
and our camping ground was soon staked out. Tents were soon pitched and the
soldiers were soon enjoying themselves. The division encamped near the Vicksburg
canal, it had just been commenced and some soldiers and negroes were at
work with spades and shovels, and some were using wheel-barrows to remove
the earth from the middle of the ditch, as it was forty feet wide. The object
was to turn the course of the father of waters into this canal. There were
dredge boats at work at the mouth of it. Each regiment had to take their turn
working on this great ditch, and some days there were over two thousand men
engaged at once, as they came from Young's Point to assist in carrying on this
great work. After three week's hard labor the water was let into it, and some
barges and one small steamboat went down through to New Carthage, and then
the water commenced falling and the dredge boats had to stop digging. There
were three of them in operation deepening the canal at this time.</p>

<p>About the middle of April several transports and gunboats ran the blockade,
passed all the batteries, and the rebels tried in vain to stop their progress, but
still they kept on until they got out of reach of the enemy's guns. There was
but few of the boats damaged and they ran the gauntlet several times. Orders
came for the division to move camp, and General Mowers' brigade moved their
camp about a mile and then commenced the work of leveling off the ground,
which was once a cotton field, and a few days after moving camp, orders came
to prepare for marching, take nothing but our haversacks and canteens, two
days rations, one blanket, forty rounds of cartridges in our boxes and our guns
in perfect order.</p>

<p>On the 2d day of May we left the mouth of this canal as it had proved of but
little use and all our work was to no purpose, and we gave up the project as no
use. The division left their camps, and owing to delays, the roads being bad,
they had to stop to repair them, so teams could pass as we had to transport our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>provisions on wagons. They did not get but a short distance from camp the
first day and the next day they marched about fifteen miles. They followed the
course of the canal all the next day, and at last we arrived at Richmond, Louisiana,
where we encamped for one night, and next morning resumed our march
and camped as before, and the division kept marching from day to day until
they arrived at Hard Times Landing. The water was getting low in the canal
and a number of barges could be seen all along the route. Our forces followed
the course of the canal until they came to a lake or bayou, and they followed
this thirty miles below Vicksburg. A bridge had to be constructed for our
forces to cross, and here we were delayed part of a day, and we remained all
night waiting to cross a bayou that ran into Black Bayou. At length we arrived
at Grand Gulf, on the opposite side of the river, where we were delayed in crossing
for several hours. Several boats were busily engaged in transporting troops
across the river, landing them on the shore. Our turn came at last, and the 11th
Missouri soon got on board and were landed on the opposite shore, and here they
remained over night, the weather being pleasant we enjoyed a good night's sleep,
and awoke quite refreshed from our weary marches.</p>

<p>On the march from Duckport through the State of Louisiana, there were several
fine plantations passed, and corn was growing finely, and indications of a
good crop. Some splendid dwellings and gardens, and every convenience to
make a person comfortable. Before this war broke out the owners of these
plantations were living in luxurious ease, nothing to do, slaves to do their bidding
and obey their commands, and they became so wealthy that they did not
know what to do with their gold, they hardly knew the value of money, they
had nothing to do but to get rich, and when this rebellion broke out they were
ripe for anything that tended to mischief. They had all left their homes and
engaged with their hearts and hands carrying on this unjust war, the almighty
negro was the cause. Many valuable lives are lost on both sides, and many
more will be lost before this unholy rebellion is crushed. All of these splendid
dwellings were destroyed with fire by the soldiers. I will fail in describing the
splendor of these dwellings and gardens. All were destroyed, costly furniture
and pianos shared the same fate of the other things, nothing was left but
smouldering ruins. Many thousand dollars worth of valuable property was destroyed,
every deserted dwelling of any value was destroyed on this march, but
we were not destined to remain at this place long. There was once a town here
but there was nothing but the brick chimneys standing to mark the place, as it
had been destroyed by a force of our men before the rebels were driven from
this stronghold, as it was a very strong natural position, but a force of our men
got in the rear of them and they left everything and fled. Tuttle's division did
not arrive in time to take any part. A small force of our men were there to
hold this position, as it was situated on a very high bluff it did not require a
strong force to hold it.</p>

<p>Everything being in readiness for a forward movement the order was given
and the division was soon on the move towards Jackson, the capital of Mississippi.
We had to march up a very high hill and kept going from one hill up
another until we had gone about two miles, and then it became easier marching.</p>

<p>We did not suffer for want of bacon, hams, sugar or molasses. Some of it
was found hid away in the brush. This was taken by the soldiers and very little
was left for the owners to use after our forces had passed.</p>

<p>Our advance had a short skirmish with the enemy on the march to Raymond,
and five men were killed and wounded on our side. They met with no more opposition
until they arrived near Raymond, when Greggs' brigade encountered
our advance, and after a desperate resistance they were forced to give way and
leave us in possession of the ground. The loss was about equal as they occupied
a ditch. The 20th Ohio and 20th Illinois charged upon them and drove
them from the ditch at the point of the bayonet. They fired a volley into our
advance as they were marching past a heavy piece of timber and took our men
partly by surprise, but they soon recovered and drove the enemy from the timber.
They could not stand cold steel, as our men rushed with impetuosity right
forward, and drove the rebels wherever they tried to make any resistance to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>advancing columns; they were bayoneted in the ditch without mercy. Our division
did not arrive in time to participate in this battle as the rebels had torn
up a bridge we had to cross and burned it, and here we were delayed several
hours waiting for the bridge to be repaired. At length the division got started
again but the battle was over before we could get to our men's assistance. After
passing through Raymond there were indications of an enemy being in advance,
when the 5th Minnesota regiment was ordered in front to examine the
timber. A line of battle was formed and the advance commenced, the 11th
Missouri following the skirmishers. They soon gained a heavy growth of timber.
It was with difficulty we could proceed. We had advanced but a short
distance into this timber when the order was given to halt, and it being evening,
the regiment remained here all night. Some rain fell during the early part of
the evening, but it did not last long. As most of us had rubber blankets we
did not suffer from the rain, and after preparing our coffee we lay down and
slept until morning. Next morning very early the brigade was ordered to fall
in, and we were soon on the way towards Jackson. We expected the rebels
would dispute our possession of a certain spring, but they did not interfere with
us here, as there was a force of cavalry here when the brigade passed in the
morning. We halted here long enough to fill our canteens with good cool
water. The roads were quite good for marching, as the rain had settled the
dust. The bugle was sounded for the command to move forward, and every regiment
was soon in motion. On to Jackson, was the word, where the rebels were
supposed to be in strong force.</p>

<p>May 14th, the morning was cloudy, and had every appearance of a storm&mdash;Our
forces had proceeded within about six miles of Jackson, when the rain commenced
falling in torrents, and the roads soon became almost impassable, but
still they moved onward until they arrived within about two miles of Jackson,
when the 5th Minnesota regiment was ordered to halt, and the 11th Missouri
was put in advance, and company B and F were sent in front to act as skirmishers,
and some of the 47th Illinois. Company F, commanded by Captain Clealand,
and company B, Lieutenant Weber. They deployed as skirmishers and
Clealand ordered them to advance. The rebels had opened from one of their
batteries and were getting the range pretty well, when the 2d Iowa battery was
ordered forward, and they opened with shot and shell and soon silenced the rebel's
guns at this place, and killed the Lieutenant of the battery. They were
shooting at our men at a long range and the order was given to advance, and
they had to cross an open field, when a volley was fired from the rebel skirmishers
and the balls whistled pretty close to us, but did no injury to any of
the company. As fast as the skirmishers advanced the rebels fell back until
they reached a very deep ditch in front of the rebel's works, and here they
had a pretty good position, when the order came to fall back to the reserve,
which was steadily advancing. A sharp fire by artillery was kept up on both
sides, but their shots passed over our heads, doing but little injury to us. The
order was given for the skirmishers to advance again, and they moved forward
again and held their position until the 95th Ohio regiment flanked the rebels
and found but few men inside the rebel works, and the rebels had fled. There
were but few prisoners taken. The citizens of the town engaged in the defense
of their capital. There were about one hundred prisoners taken and several
pieces of cannon, with all the equipments belonging to them. Our loss on the
left was severe, and it was here that the rebels had advantage of position.&mdash;Logan's
division charged a battery and in spite of the heavy fire from the rebel
guns drove them from their guns at the point of the bayonet, and for fear
of being surrounded they left everything and fled, leaving nothing but a few
artillerists to defend their works. The ground where Logan's men charged
across was quite level, and the enemy's batteries was placed to take any part
of it, and it was in crossing this that our forces met with the heaviest loss.
Mowers' brigade marched to the court house and stacked arms. It rained most
of the time and tents were discovered in a warehouse, and they were soon appropriated
to our use. Every regiment was supplied. This was a place of
great importance to the rebels, the capital of Mississippi, and in time of peace
contained nearly five thousand inhabitants, and a great deal of business was done.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>There were mills for the manufacture of cotton goods, an arsenal for the making
of arms, and everything requisite to carry on this cruel war. Tobacco,
whisky, sugar, molasses, and flour were found in great abundance. Confederate
scrip would pass for full value with the inhabitants of the town. As soon as
the soldiers gained possession of the town commenced the work of plunder,
breaking open stores, everything of value was taken, and most every soldier in
the brigade was dressed in citizens' clothes. Whisky was plenty, and a good
many of the boys got tight. Guards were placed over the town, but they were
of no avail, and the soldiers distributed shoes to the citizens, and almost every
thing that could be got was given to them, as these things were owned by speculators,
and were sold to the people of the town at the highest prices. But the
soldiers did not long enjoy their new suits, for the order came to wash and dry
their uniforms, as they could not wear citizens' clothes any longer than was
necessary. They came very acceptable, as our clothes were wet and muddy,
having been in the rain all day.</p>

<p>The brigade remained two nights and one day here, and I was detailed to go
as a guard to protect some citizens. One was a preacher, and he treated the
guard quite kindly; one was a retired merchant from Massachusetts. He said
if he was only able to handle a musket and bear the fatigue of marching, he
would be in the rebel army, and four of us were protecting him from insult and
his property from being destroyed; The town was being illuminated, and there
was a great deal of it on fire, and many public buildings were being destroyed.
The soldiers had received marching orders to leave the next day, and the object
was to leave no building standing, but they were restrained by the guards.
When morning came we returned to our regiment, and the order was given to
burn the tents and break every gun not in use.</p>

<p>After everything was prepared the order came to leave the town, as the rebels
were advancing in strong force to drive us out. The railroad was all torn up,
and burned to the bridge at Black Water, by our forces. We soon left the
town with the bands playing Dixie. The Confederate House, which had but
recently been built, was burned down. The people were glad to see us leave.
A good many of the boys remained behind, and the division had got but a short
distance from town when a rebel force of cavalry entered it, and all that had
remained behind were made prisoners and paroled or taken to Richmond to be
exchanged. A Colonel of the 47th Illinois went back to town on some business
connected with his men, when he was ordered to surrender, whereupon he drew
his revolver and commenced shooting, when he was shot dead. He was a prisoner
once, and said he never would be taken again.</p>

<p>The division marched until evening, when they were allowed a short time to
prepare some coffee; had barely time to finish drinking coffee when the bugle
sounded. The advance had to fall in, take arms, and the command was soon on
the move again. They came to a halt late in the evening, and next morning
were on the move again. By some mistake we missed the right road, and after
marching two miles the command was halted. The heavy thundering of cannon
and small arms could be distinctly heard. The news came that our forces had
driven the rebels from the railroad bridge across the Black Water after an obstinate
resistence.</p>

<p>After halting here for a short time, the order was given to forward, march,
file right, and we had to retrace our steps until we got back to where we stopped
over night. There we turned to the left, and marched until the heat of the day,
and then halted for dinner. After eating, the march was resumed until we arrived
at Black Water, and after staying here one night and part of a day before
crossing the stream, a fine horse was purchased by the privates of the 11th Missouri
and presented to <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Mowers. He had several horses shot while engaged
in battle. He made a few remarks&mdash;it was unexpected to him, and took him by
surprise. After this was over the division crossed the river on a pontoon bridge,
and the bridge was taken up as soon as we crossed. Here the division bivouacked
for the night. Next morning most of the division moved forward with
the exception of part of the 11th Missouri, which was detailed to guard some
ammunition and artillery which had been captured from the rebels. Soon after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>the ammunition and artillery were removed, and we left the river to rejoin the
brigade. Several hundred confederate prisoners who had been taken in the late
battles, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>We rejoined the brigade, and quite late in the evening arrived in front of the
rebel works. Here the army stopped, and the lines extended all around the city
of Vicksburg. Here we remained until the evening of the 21st, when an order
was read with reference to storming the rebel works on the following day. Meanwhile
several batteries were busily engaged throwing shot and shell into the
rebel works from morning until night, and it was not safe to go within sight of
the rebel works and expose ourselves to their sharpshooters, as several of our
soldiers were struck over 800 yards from the fort.</p>

<p>From Black river there is a range of high hills, of deep valleys, and heavy
timber, until arriving within half a mile of the rebel works. The timber had all
been cut down, and there was no way of approaching the rebel works except by
roads, and these were well protected by artillery, and the forts were so built
that they commanded every road with stockades.</p>

<p>The morning of the 22d of May, a day long to be remembered by many was,
dark and cloudy. Our lines were formed, and the brigade marched a short distance
from the enemy's works and ordered to stop; and here they lay until four
o'clock in the afternoon, when the order was given to fall in line, and not speak
a word, as the brigade was going to make an effort to get inside of the rebel
works. The 11th Missouri was in advance. Up they went on double-quick to
within 300 yards, when the rebels opened on us with shot and shell, and their
sharp-shooters from behind their works were pouring volleys of rifle bullets into
our ranks as they advanced. Whole ranks were shot down, either killed or
wounded, and only about 30 reached the works. The Colonel of the 11th led
the charge, and reached the outer ditch. While there the rebels threw a hand
grenade and it tore off the front of his cap, doing him no other injury. The
colors were planted on the outer works, and there they had to remain until
evening, when, under cover of darkness, the Colonel got away, with the men
that had regained the works. At night the brigade returned to our old camping
place. It was a terrible day, for the regiment was exposed to a heavy fire,
failing back with heavy loss without accomplishing any thing. The loss was
over a hundred men in killed and wounded. After remaining a few days after the
storming of the enemy's entrenchments, order came, and the 2d brigade had to
move again; and early in the evening our lines were formed, the command was
given, and every regiment was soon in motion&mdash;destination not known. After
marching until quite late, halted, and camped for the night near a creek. The
night being warm, we had a comfortable sleep with our blankets and the sky
above to cover us. We were not disturbed until morning. Next morning after
eating breakfast we resumed our march, until we arrived at Snyder's Bluffs, and
here we came to a halt, and remained one night and part of a day. This was a
strong position, held by the rebels, but on the approach of our forces was vacated,
as there was danger of being cut off from the main army at Vicksburg. It
was a place of little importance, as there was nothing but hills and valleys and
some rebel entrenchments. A very small portion of the land could be cultivated.
There were some people living in these hills, and seemed to enjoy themselves.
But few men were to be seen at home, as they were gone into the rebel
army.</p>

<p>Orders came at last, and the brigade was soon in motion again on the road to
Yazoo City. After marching up one hill and down another, the brigade arrived
at Mechanicsburg, where our cavalry fell in with a force of rebel cavalry and
there was a short skirmish. The infantry went to the cavalry's assistance, when
the rebels broke and fled. Our casualties were slight; not much loss on either
side. The cavalry did not pursue the enemy far, but returned and camped for
the night at Mechanicsburg, where the infantry had kindled fires. You could
see where each regiment was halted and were resting from their weary day's
march.</p>

<p>At the sound of the bugle in the morning every soldier seemed to spring into
life again, and were soon all interested in the work of preparing their meal. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>work was soon over, most of the boys being their own cooks, and carried their
cooking utensils along with them. Water was not very plenty, and most of it
cistern water.</p>

<p>Mechanicsburg was a small town with a few old houses in it, and no business
worth mentioning being done there. Everything appeared desolate and forsaken.
Next morning we left this place for Haines' Bluff. Our road lay through
a heavy timber; it was a road not much traveled at this time. We followed
this road until we came to a very large plantation, and here the command halted
for a short time. Finding plenty of chickens here, the soldiers took most of
them, and when the command moved forward there was not a rooster left to
crow on the plantation. There were a great many negroes on this place, their
master in the rebel army, and he very wealthy, owning three large plantations.
After staying here a short time the command was ordered to move forward, and
each regiment was soon in motion again. After emerging from the hills we
struck a flat open country along the Yazoo river, where corn was growing finely,
and would soon make good forage. The command halted for dinner, after which
we moved forward again, and late in the evening came to a halt near a creek of
clear water; here the command bivouacked for the night. Next morning the
march was resumed again, and then commenced the work of climbing a very
high hill, and leaving the Yazoo bottoms. At length the whole army reached
the summit of Haines' Bluffs.</p>

<p>The weather had become very warm and it was almost impossible to march,
but there was a cool breeze stirring on the hills, and if it were not for this the
command would have had to halt, as the heat was almost suffocating.</p>

<p>Haines' Bluffs was on the Yazoo river and had been in possession of the rebels,
who, for some cause, had left. After blowing up the magazine they went into
Vicksburg, and our forces soon took possession. It was a place of vast importance
to us, as we could get our supplies from the river, and provisions could be
hauled by teams and wagons to the besieging army very easily, as it was but a
short distance to the landing. The army got plenty to eat here, but we were
not suffered to remain long.</p>

<p>One morning early the brigade was ordered on board steamboats, which were
in waiting to receive us on board. There were several of them in the river,
and one was a gunboat which was to accompany us on the expedition. This day
was passed on the boat, everything ready and waiting the signal to move. At
last we got under way and the boats moved up the river.</p>

<p>The Yazoo river is a long narrow stream, full of short turns; our largest boats
could not navigate it. Our destination was unknown to us at that time. At
daylight next morning the boats landed us at a place called Setorsia, a small
town, containing one church, a few stores and groceries. As soon as the boats
stopped the soldiers were soon on shore, the stores plundered of everything they
contained, which was not much. <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Mower ordered them on board again.
Returning to the boats the order came to form in line on land. Signs of an
enemy were to be seen, and skirmishers were thrown out to see if the road was
clear. The 8th Wisconsin was in advance, and had moved but a short distance
from the town, when the advance fell in with some of the enemy's cavalry, and
they commenced to fire on the 8th. The skirmishers and brigade halted on the
side of a hill, when the rebels fled before them as they advanced, keeping it up
all the way to Mechanicsburg. Two of the 8th were severely wounded. Here
they resolved we should go no further. They formed their line of battle about
one mile and a half from town, and there awaited our approach. A battery was
ordered forward, and they opened fire where the rebels were supposed to be;
after shelling them a short time, the rebels returned the fire, doing no injury to
our men, as they shot too high. A battalion of the 5th Illinois cavalry was
ordered to make a charge, which was done in gallant style. They bore down
on the rebels with sabres glistening in the sun, rushing at full speed upon the
enemy, which was in line of battle to receive them; but what could withstand
such a charge? The sabre was the principle weapon used. This was too close
work for them, and they broke and fled, taking their artillery with them. The
cavalry took 70 prisoners. Their loss in killed not known; a large number were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>wounded with the sabre. The infantry moved forward to the support of the
cavalry, but the rebels were dispersed before the infantry could render any assistance.
The rebels were supposed to be about 3,000 strong, mostly mounted infantry.
They could not stand but a short time before the impetuous valor of
our brave men, fighting for the right. They made several ineffectual attempts at
resistance, but they were at last forced to flee and leave us victors.</p>

<p>The cavalry pursued the retreating rebels several miles, cutting them down
with their sabres whenever they overtook them. Some of the men were quite
old and gray. The infantry went about a half a mile from town and there
camped for the night.</p>

<p>Company B, 11th Missouri, and a company of the 47th Illinois, were sent out
in front to act as a grand guard; and here we remained for twenty-four hours,
when we were relieved by company C, and returned to the regiment. Order
was then given to draw two days' rations, as we were to march next morning.
At six o'clock next morning we made preparations to march, drawing another
day's rations, and began our return to Haines' Bluff. Our knapsacks had arrived
but were returned again to the boats.</p>

<p>The 11th Missouri was rear guard and the advance moved quite slow, owing to
the extreme heat; it was almost impossible to proceed sometimes; no air stirring,
and some of the soldiers died on the way. A great many were sunstruck.
We marched back to Sertorsia, which was destroyed, and Mechanicsburg was
left burning.</p>

<p>After leaving the timber part of a division fell in with our brigade. On this
expedition there were three brigades of infantry, under command of <abbr title="Brigadier General">Brig. Gen.</abbr>
Kimble; also several regiments of cavalry, with artillery. The Yazoo bottom
road was taken. Corn had been planted by order of Jeff. Davis, and it was
growing finely on each side of the road; some of the stalks were higher than
our heads as we passed along. It would soon make good forage for our cavalry.
This road was dry and dusty. There was plenty of water on the bottom, as there
were cisterns every few miles. The first day we marched until late, and came to
a halt near a creek of running water, and next day arrived at our old camp early
in the evening. After remaining here a short time we went by steamboat to
Youngs Point.</p>

<p>On the march from Mechanicsburg the 11th lost several men; they were behind
and were taken by rebel cavalry, who were picking up stragglers, but did
not get many, as our cavalry were protecting the rear, and they did not venture
up very close. All cotton was burned on this march, also some corn and a few
houses, one a very fine house occupied by a rebel. Everything of value was
taken because he aided in capturing some of our boys by making signals to a
party of bushwhackers. He was taken and delivered as a prisoner to the General.
The brigade marched to Young's Point, established camp, where we were
soon at home.</p>

<p>After resting for a few days orders were received for the brigade to prepare for
a move next morning. Everything was found ready on the 14th of June, and
on Sunday every regiment was formed in line and soon moved from Young's
Point to go to Richmond, Louisiana, where the rebels were said to be in force,
throwing up entrenchments. We were sent out to reconnoitre on the 15th, after
a good night's rest. Our advance fed in with some of the enemy's skirmishers
when about two miles from Richmond. The 5th Minnesota was acting as skirmishers.
A line of battle was formed, and then the order was given to forward,
and the whole line moved to the support of the skirmishers. When within a
mile of Richmond the skirmishers were saluted with a shower of bullets, but
most of them passed harmlessly over their heads. Two of the 5th were slightly
wounded, which was all the damage we received. Two batteries were brought
into play; one was handled by some men of the marine brigade, and they did
some good shooting. They came from Millikin's Bend. The 11th Missouri was
supporting Taylor's battery. The rebels would send an occasional shot at us as
we were laying down in front of our artillery, and after firing over 100 rounds
from the two batteries, General Mower discovered where the rebels were. They
occupied a strong position on the opposite side of Wolf creek. He rode along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>the lines, each regiment being in its place, and the command was given to move
across this creek and take the rebels in the rear. The marine brigade was ordered
to take our place to support the batteries. After marching through a
heavy piece of timber, we emerged into an open field near the creek, and then
we could see the rebels retreating, and our advance in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>We soon reached the creek opposite the town and crossed over. There was
evidence of there having been a strong force there, as their shanties were left
standing, and deserters informed us that there were 7,000 of Taylor's and Walker's
men here when we attacked them in the morning. They had dug some rifle
pits and had several pieces of artillery, but used them very little. One man lay
dead in a ditch, and two were wounded, one of them seriously. They were injured
by a shell.</p>

<p>A battalion of the 10th Illinois cavalry pursued the retreating rebels and
took 30 prisoners, with slight loss on our side. The citizens of the town fled
with the retreating rebels, as they were informed that they would be protected
inside the rebel lines. Some of them taking nothing with them, and our men
soon took possession. And then commenced the work of plunder, as everything
was ordered to be destroyed, the town was soon in ashes; there was nothing but
a heap of ruins two hours after our forces took possession.</p>

<p>The day passed away and night found us three miles from Richmond, where
we halted for the night. The marine brigade returned to their boats that evening,
burning everything as they went. Arrived at Young's Point at 1 o'clock on
the 16th day of June. The sun was sending its hottest rays upon us, and it was
almost impossible to proceed. We had water a short distance from camp and
plenty of it; it was not good, and the brigade soon felt the effects of using this
water. Ague and fever became frequent, and several men died in the brigade.
We remained here encamped until after the surrender of Vicksburg. You may
judge of our feelings when we learned that the rebels had surrendered to Grant.
It was hardly believed that one of the strongholds of the rebellion was in our
possession, and the father of waters was open to commerce again from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Louis to New Orleans.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr></span> ANDREW JACKSON WEBER,<br />

<i>11th Missouri Regiment, Mortally Wounded, June 29th, 1863, in front of Vicksburg.</i></h3>

<p>Nothing of importance transpired until the 28th of June, and then the 11th
Missouri was ordered in front of Vicksburg as grand guard, and while there
the rebels commenced shelling us. A piece of shell striking <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Weber on the
head, he fell mortally wounded. This was on the morning of the 29th; he
lived until the morning of the 30th. In him the 11th Missouri lost a true friend,
and it was with sorrow we followed his body to the boat which was to convey
him home. His corpse was put on board of the boat, and after a short prayer,
we returned to camp. All of the brigade followed his body to the boat, as he
was universally esteemed by every one who knew him. Although young in years,
he had the qualifications rendering him an able commander. He was captain
of company B, 11th Missouri, until we arrived at Point Pleasant, but for services
rendered there, he was raised to the rank of major, which post he held for
some time. At length he was raised to the rank of lieutenant colonel, vice
Penny Baker, resigned on account of ill health. He filled every place with
honor to himself and with the esteem and friendship of his brother officers. He
was a sober officer, and took pride in seeing his men appear well, and was the
first to face danger, always kind and obliging, never resorting to extreme measures,
he won the good will of his men, who would follow him wherever he saw
fit to lead them. He encountered cold, hunger and fatigue, and endured many
privations along with his men; had passed safely through several hard fought
battles, and was always cool and collected in the midst of danger; always in
front of his company or regiment. He was always with his regiment, and took
an active part in all the battles that the 11th Missouri was engaged in, and escaped
unharmed until the 29th day of June, when he was stricken down in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>prime of life. His remains were sent home on the 2d day of July. George
Weber accompanied the last remains of as brave and gallant an officer as ever
drew a sword.</p>

<p>The brigade remained encamped at Young's Point until after the surrender of
Vicksburg which happened on the 4th day of July, 1863. <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Pemberton
surrendered with his whole army, which was paroled, and a great many of the
men took the oath of allegiance to the U. S. Government, went home, declaring
they would fight no more for Jeff. Davis and his minions.</p>

<p>While here the climate began to tell on the men in the brigade, and several
fell sick and some died. At last we got on to steamboats and were transferred
to Vicksburg, and from there to Black Water on the cars. Here tents were
pitched, and the brigade remained for nearly two weeks. From this place the
camp was removed ten miles to a heavy piece of timber, which answered very
well for a shade; a choice spot was selected for a camp, the ground cleaned
off, the tents pitched, and each regiment and brigade took its respective place.
Officers' tents in line of the rear of the privates. On laying out the ground for
a camp, so much ground is allowed to each company, and every tent must be in
line with the others. The ground has to be swept every morning between the
tents, and the dirt hauled off in wagons. At this camp we remained for two
months; the last month we remained here there was a grand review every
Thursday, and company inspection every Sunday. While here <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Mowers
returned from the hospital, where he had been on account of ill health. He
took command of the brigade again, in the place of <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Hubbard, who was
acting brigadier at this time. George Weber also returned from taking his
brother home about this time, also Captain J. D. Lloyd, of company B, returned
from Memphis, and took command of his company.</p>

<p>The country is very broken and hilly for miles around Vicksburg. Some
corn near our camp was used for forage. Peaches were in great plenty. The
boys would go out miles from camp foraging, bringing in hogs, chickens, and
most all kinds of produce. Several of the boys were taken prisoners by guerrillas,
and an order was issued to stop going outside the lines. The boys' mules
and horses were taken and turned over to the quartermasters.</p>

<p>Deaths became frequent, and soldiers died off very fast; some regiments lost
a good many men. Here company B lost two. We remained at this point two
months, and on the 26th day of September the brigade returned to Black Water
again, pitching their tents in the old camping ground.</p>

<p>September 26th. Early in the evening our tents were ordered to be taken
down and loaded on the wagons, and the brigade was ordered to prepare for
leaving this camp and return to Black River bridge. Everything being in readiness,
the advance was sounded, and each regiment took its place and off they
started. The weather was fine, the moon was shining brightly, and the roads
were quite dry and dusty. The brigade soon reached our old camping ground,
and after our tents came they were pitched, and here the brigade remained,
without anything worthy of notice transpiring until the 14th of October, when
Mowers' brigade and the 2d Iowa battery was ordered to get ready to leave
camp, taking six days' provisions and 40 rounds of ammunition to the man.
The first day we went as far as <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Tuttle's headquarters, where we camped for
the night, and next morning Tuttle's and Logan's divisions and a brigade of cavalry,
all under command of <abbr title="Major">Maj.</abbr> <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> McPherson, crossed Black River on a
bridge. Mowers' brigade was detailed to guard the train of the division, and
night found us at a small town called Brownsville. Here Tuttle's division came
to a halt, and the 11th Missouri was detailed to act as grand guard. Our lines
were formed near the town, and one man was shot by some of the rebel bushwhackers;
we were not disturbed again. In the morning we were ready to
move forward, when the order came to advance. In this place there was nothing
but a few empty houses, used as stores. Nothing of value could be seen; if
there was anything it was concealed, so that few contraband goods were obtained.
While marching through this place next morning some goods were discovered
in a house belonging to a Jew. The regiment stopping at this place for a
short time, some of the soldiers helped themselves to whatever they could find;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>but a guard being placed over this house, not much could be obtained.</p>

<p>The roar of cannon broke upon our ears, and we could tell by the sound that
it was some distance ahead of us. It continued for a short time, and then
ceased, and we were ordered forward, but soon came to a halt again. In this
way we proceeded all day. At nightfall we came to a halt, and camped, the
brigade forming a hollow square. Here we remained till morning, when the
order came to fall in and move forward.</p>

<p>The cavalry had found the rebels and were shelling them with their howitzers.
After marching us about a mile we came in full view of them. Logan's division
was in line of battle. Skirmishers were thrown forward and the advance commenced.
The rebels occupied a good position on a hill, and were supposed to
be in strong force. It was a splendid sight to see the blue coats ascend the hill.
Skirmishing was kept up and the rebels fell back slowly, firing as they went.
They made but little opposition to our men, and soon they left us masters of the
field.</p>

<p>Tuttle's division had halted, and was now ordered forward again. After advancing
about a mile we came to a halt, stacked arms, and bivouacked. Rain
fell during the night, and the roads next day were quite muddy, making it pretty
hard marching. We were ordered back to Black River bridge, where we arrived
on the sixth day after leaving camp. Part of this expedition was sent to destroy
a mill which contained a great quantity of provisions. The cavalry, which was
in advance, encountered a battery which was placed in position to defend the
mill. The cavalry being fired upon, they fell back, and formed a line of battle,
and a battery of light artillery was brought forward and opened on the rebels,
where they were supposed to be, and the place was soon made too warm for
them. A charge was made, and several prisoners taken, with a small loss on
our side. After the rebels left, the mill and a machine shop was burned; then
returned to camp. After this was accomplished, and as soon as the rebels discovered
that the army was on its way back to camp, they returned to harrass
our rear. The cavalry had several skirmishes with them during the day, as they
would come up and engage our rear guard, but in every instance were driven
back. They followed us up to Edwards' Station. It took us two days to return
to camp again, marching 40 miles in a day and a half. Sometimes we were on
double-quick, and marched in single file on the right of the wagons the whole
length of the train. How glad were we when we could see the tops of our
tents in the distance. Tired and foot sore, we laid down to rest our weary
limbs, and our sleep was enjoyed the first night of our arrival in camp, and we
awoke much refreshed. This was the 21st of October, and here we remained
until November. About the 6th orders came to strike tents and get ready to
move camp.</p>

<p>Everything was put on board the cars but the wagons and artillery, and landed
at Vicksburg. The wagons were hauled there by the teams, the artillery was
put on board steamboats that were in waiting to receive us. Tuttle's division
was soon on its way to Memphis. The 11th Missouri was on the boat with General
Mowers. The weather was pretty cool and dry, and everything went on favorably
until our boat was struck by a floating snag, which tore a hole in the
front of it, and it was also set on fire several times by some person or persons
on board. It was discovered in time to prevent serious damage.</p>

<p>At length we arrived at Memphis, where the division all landed. One brigade
remained at Memphis and the other two were left at posts along the railroad as
guards. The second brigade under Mowers was carried by railroad to La Grange,
Tennessee. Our train had proceeded but a short distance from Memphis when
it was fired into and a negro killed in the 11th Missouri, and two of the 5th
Minnesota wounded; also a negro in the second Iowa battery was killed. Firing
on trains had become quite common, but an order was issued that put a stop to
it. Every citizen was held responsible for damage done the railroad by roaming
bands of guerrillas who were watching opportunities to obstruct the passage of
trains running from Corinth to Memphis.</p>

<p>When we arrived here there was but a small force of cavalry stationed at this
point, and it was the rebels' intention to attack the place, but they were so long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>in making up their minds what to do that I don't think they will venture very
close to us again. We arrived here near the middle of November, and remained
until the 1st of December, when the order came to prepare for marching.&mdash;Taking
three days' rations in our haversacks, with our blankets and canteens,
we were soon on the march again at daylight. Our destination was Pocahontas.
We marched up one hill and down another until we arrived within a mile
of a small town on the railroad called Middletown. Tired and foot sore, we
came to a halt and bivouacked for the night. Our march was along the railroad,
and we passed through Grand Junction and Salsbury. At the latter place
part of the 8th Wisconsin regiment and some Tennessee cavalry, were stationed.
When the brigade passed through the 8th was ordered to accompany it, and
when they arrived at Salsbury the town was left without a guard. The rebel
cavalry came right in the rear of us and tore up the railroad and burned several
houses of the town. Notice was given the General that the rebels were in our
rear, when the command was ordered back. The cavalry being in advance they
fell in with the rebels a short distance from this town. They were posted in line
of battle and were determined to prevent our return to camp. The artillery
was soon brought into play, and after shelling them some time, doing but little
damage on either side, the rebels gave way and left our forces in possession of
the ground. A large open field formed the battle ground, with timber on each
side. A running fight was kept up all day, a few prisoners were taken. How
glad were we when we could see La Grange again. We reached camp about
four o'clock, having marched over forty miles in less than two days. That night
we slept until morning, and awoke much refreshed.</p>

<p>There was a great stir in camp next morning, caused by the report that the
rebels were seen hovering around our lines. No one was allowed to leave camp,
and our arms were stacked on the color line, and we were ordered to be ready
to take arms at a moment's warning, as there was no knowing what moment the
enemy would make the attack. We were not long destined to remain in camp.
The regiment was detailed to work on breastworks, and when the fort was nearly
completed the order came to march again, and we had to lay by the shovel and
pick and take up our guns and try the fortunes of the field again. Two regiments
of the second brigade, 47th Illinois, and 11th Missouri, got on the cars
and went to Corinth, Mississippi, and here they bivouacked one night in some
old empty quarters that had been occupied by soldiers. In the morning the
command was ordered to move, and early on the morning of the 21st took our
line of march, and night found us within four miles of Purdy, having marched
twenty miles. Next morning we moved about five miles and bivouacked until
the morning of the third day at half-past two o'clock, when we were ordered
again to march, and that night we came to a halt within twenty miles of Jackson,
Tennessee, where the rebel General Forrest, was said to have his headquarters.
We marched this day thirty miles. Here we remained all night and next
day until nearly dark, when we were ordered to march again, and the command
was soon on its way back to Corinth again. After marching to within six miles
of Purdy, the command came to a halt until morning and next day traveled
about ten miles, and were told to make ourselves as comfortable as possible, as
we would remain here all night. But an order came for us to return if possible,
to La Grange. The next evening at seven o'clock the sky had the appearance of
an approaching storm. At about one o'clock that morning we started for
Corinth, and arrived there, the rain falling heavily and the roads becoming so
slippery and muddy that it was tedious marching. At two o'clock we were on
the cars again, and soon left Corinth for La Grange, where we arrived late in
the evening, wet and cold. We retired to our quarters where we soon forgot our
fatigue in the arms of slumber, having been absent eight days. We did not
discover a rebel on this march, but could hear of them every day, and there
would be slight skirmishing with our advance cavalry. Not much loss was sustained
on either side. The expedition was commanded by General Mowers but
I never learned the object of it as nothing was accomplished. General Forrest
was said to have crossed the railroad a few miles from La Grange.</p>

<p>Our stay was short, an order came to go to Grand Junction, and there the 11th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>remained for several days without tents to cover themselves. It rained twenty-four
hours, and from rain it turned to snow, and froze quite hard. It was almost
impossible to endure the cold. We were allowed to return to camp, and
how cheering were the camp fires to us that evening, as the snow was falling
and the wind blowing a strong breeze from the north-west. As our tents had
fire-places in them we did not suffer much from the cold of January, 1864.</p>

<p>Here we remained until the 26th of January, when we were ordered to prepare
for leaving this camp for Memphis. As most of this railroad was to be
abandoned, every available article was removed to Memphis, or inside the Union
lines. The 11th and 47th Illinois, were detailed to guard the wagon train into
Memphis. After two days we arrived in sight of that city, and here came to a
halt and remained a short time. The boys received pay and were ordered on
transports which were awaiting to convey troops down the river. At length,
all things ready, the boats headed down the river, and we soon found ourselves
in front of Vicksburg. Here we landed, formed in line and were soon on the
way to Black River bridge, where we arrived on the 4th day of February. A
brigade had left their tents standing for the 11th Missouri to occupy.</p>

<p>Left Black River bridge, where we were in camp, March 4th, 1864. The regiment
occupied the 20th Illinois quarters as they had left their tents standing,
and they kindly tendered them to us while they were absent with Sherman on
an expedition to Meridian. Tuttle's division was to have gone but did not arrive
in time. The expedition had gone before we got there and we had to remain
behind. We remained until Sherman's army returned to Canton, Mississippi,
when the second brigade was ordered to guard a wagon train of prisoners
through to Sherman, whose command had come to a halt and was awaiting supplies.
The train went through all right, and how glad were the boys when
supplies arrived, they were suffering for the want of something to eat. Their
supplies had been all consumed, and they had to subsist on parched corn and
fresh pork without salt, and could not get enough of that. The expedition
was gone over a month, and had marched over three hundred miles without
a change of clothing, with twenty days rations. Everything was destroyed as
they went; railroads were torn up, and corn destroyed, which was a great
loss to the rebels. They found scarcely anything to oppose them; a few slight
skirmishes now and then, but no general engagement. After obtaining supplies
the regiment returned to camp again. Five of the 11th Missouri were
gobbled up while foraging on this march, and have not been heard from since.
As soon as we returned to camp again the regiment, with Tuttle's division, were
ordered to Vicksburg, and soon were on the move again.</p>

<p>An expedition was fitting out to go up Red River, but the 11th had re-enlisted
and were promised a furlough home, while all non-veterans were transferred
to other regiments. There were nearly a hundred non-veterans of the
11th Missouri regiment. We pitched our tents in the rear of town and there
waited to be transferred; the veterans to go home. As I was one of the non-veterans
I was destined to be separated for a while from my comrades. We
were transferred to the 33d Missouri, and were soon on the way to Red River.
A fleet of transports and gunboats were in this expedition; Smith and
Mower were in command; in all, twelve thousand five hundred men, infantry
and artillery; a picked body of men who never knew what it was to turn their
backs on the foe.</p>

<p>Our transfer took place on the 8th of March, after dark. Rain fell that day
and the ground had become slippery and muddy; it was difficult to walk without
falling. This wading through mud could easily have been prevented if the
order had been received in time to have gone to the boats by daylight. As
it was we had to endure considerable suffering going from shelter and sleeping
on the bank of the river until morning. It was lucky for us that it did not
rain any more that day; but the skies looked very threatening. In the morning
we were assigned to company B, of the 33d Missouri. There were thirteen
of us; seventy-eight belonging to the 11th. Some were assigned to each company
in the regiment. Lieut. <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Heathe was in command of the regiment.
As my object is to give an account of the expedition I will not be particular
in giving the names of officers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>We remained one day on board of the transport Hamilton. On the 10th,
everything being ready, the gunboats in advance and the transports loading,
we started for Red River. The boats came to anchor at the mouth of Atchafalaya
bayou, where the troops landed and burned a rebel's house after plundering
it, and the men would have hung the owner but General Mower interposed and
saved his life. The soldiers were ordered on board the boats again and a guard
was stationed in front of each boat, that no soldier might go on shore again.&mdash;Here
we remained all night, and in the morning the fleet entered the mouth of
Atchafalaya bayou, which was followed for several miles; anchored at a place
called Simsport, where there had been a rebel encampment. Some earthworks
could be seen but the rebels fled on our approach. Here some of the troops
landed, and in the morning marched four miles, where they discovered a fort.&mdash;It
was across a bayou called Yellow bayou. This was a strong position and was
very hard to approach; if the enemy had chosen to make a stand, would have
given our men trouble to dislodge them, as they had to cross a bayou and a
ditch fifteen feet deep, which would almost have been an impossibility. No resistance
was made however, and this position was evacuated and our men soon
had possession. Every available article was burned and the works were destroyed.
The rebels fell back to a stronger position on Red River. Mower,
with his men, returned to Simsport, stacked arms on shore, and we were ordered
to prepare ourselves with two days' rations in our haversacks. Everything
was soon ready, and we waiting for the command to move forward. It was on
a beautiful Sabbath evening and the boys were in fine spirits. The order came
at last, and off we started, went marching that evening eight miles; came to a
halt, and the next morning were on the move again quite early. There was
nothing worth relating until our arrival within two miles of Red River, where a
very strong position was held by a force of rebels, and they resolved to make a
stand. There were several siege pieces in position which were covered by a
fort. It would have been almost an impossibility to capture it if it had been
finished. Three guns commanded all approaches by the river; they were nine-inch
guns captured from us and taken off the Indianola. The water battery
was protected with railroad iron with a foot of white oak frame work. One gun
was not mounted yet, but they were working on it when Mower spoiled their
calculation and captured all their guns and destroyed these works, which had
taken them a year to complete. After examining this position Mower immediately
ordered an advance, with skirmishers in front, while the artillery was
opened and a heavy fire was kept up on the rebel works. The rebels returned
the fire with a will, but doing no damage. A brigade of infantry was steadily
advancing, firing as they went. Soon it began to take effect, as our men neared
the rebel position, and made it dangerous to show themselves. The firing had
nearly ceased on their part when a charge was made, General Mower leading
them. The works were soon gained. It was almost impossible to get into the
fort, owing to the ditch around it, but with the assistance of one another gained
the works. When they got on top of the works they pulled each other up by
the aid of their guns. The garrison surrendered with eleven pieces of heavy artillery;
also a quantity of ammunition, with nearly three hundred prisoners, who
were sent to New Orleans. As it was in Banks' department all prisoners had to
be sent there from here. Mower embarked with all the troops but one brigade
of infantry, which was left behind to destroy the works, under the orders of A.
J. Smith, who was in command of both corps. The regiments that made the
assault were the following: 24th Missouri, 89th Indiana, 119th Illinois, 14th
Iowa and 21st Missouri, non-veterans.</p>

<p>As the order was received at the same time to take the rebel works by assault,
all moved at once, and the 24th Missouri claims the honor of planting the first
flag on the fort, but all deserve praise for the manner in which the order was
obeyed. Every one was confident of victory. On they went under a heavy
fire, and were soon in possession of one of the strongest positions in Louisiana.
It was well planned. There were places in the fort for prisoners, and ammunition
would be safe from harm. The gunboats were to assist in taking the fort,
but did not arrive in time to take part in the engagement owing to obstructions
in the river, which the boats had to remove before they could get along. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>caused some delay. A few shots were fired from the boats, but the fort was taken
by this time. Our advance was in possession of the fort by six o'clock
in the evening.</p>

<p>As our brigade was in the rear, did not arrive in time to take part in the engagement.
We were waiting to receive the order to support the advance, but
as our assistance was not needed, we stacked our arms two miles from the fort, in
an open field, and there remained until morning, when we marched to the landing
where the fleet was awaiting us. We all embarked with the exception of
one brigade, which remained behind to destroy everything that could not be
removed. From carelessness or some other cause, several men were killed and
wounded in the destruction of the works; nearly as many as there were in
taking them. The rest of the forces under Mower proceeded to Alexandria,
the gunboats going in advance, the transports following. Our progress was
very slow, only about five miles an hour. This stream is very crooked and narrow,
and might be very easily blockaded. The gunboats proceed cautiously.
Parker discovered there were torpedoes placed in the river, and four of these
infernal machines were taken out before getting very close to them. The fleet
arrived at last at Alexandria. All the troops landed, and tents were pitched,
and the men were allowed several days to rest and recruit up; but we were not
destined to remain long idle.</p>

<p>An expedition was fitted out, and after marching about 40 miles, surprised
and captured nearly 300 more confederates, with four pieces of artillery. It
was under a heavy storm of wind and rain when this capture was made in the
dead hour of night, on the 21st of March. Mowers captured the courier, who
had the countersign, and by this means deceived the guard, as they imagined
that it was reinforcements from Walker. They little thought the Yankees were
so close, and were surprised to find themselves in the presence of strangers.
We treated them quite civilly, as they were prisoners of war, and were taken
without firing a shot. When they discovered how easily they had been taken
in, their rage knew no bounds. The 33d Missouri assisted in making this capture.
They were marched to Alexandria, while some of the boys rode their
horses they were compelled to walk. They were put on board a boat and sent
to New Orleans.</p>

<p>On returning to Alexandria we found Banks and staff had arrived. Lee, who
was chief of cavalry, came into town; it was the advance of Banks' army&mdash;it
soon came, and encamped in the rear of town for several days. While here
three more pieces of artillery were discovered, concealed by the rebels in their
haste to get away. They were field pieces, which made in all 18 pieces, with
600 prisoners; a great quantity of sugar and molasses was also captured.
Smith's men were called thieves and robbers by Banks, who said they would not
fight. He started with the 13th corps, the invincible 19th going ahead, and
came to a halt at Grandecore, and there awaited Smith's coming, who was to
bring up the rear. Smith arrived, and the troops marched above the falls, and
the fleet soon followed, but some of our largest gunboats had to remain at Alexandria,
as they drew too much water to get over the falls. After getting over
the falls the troops embarked on board the boats again and went to Grandecore.
Here there was a short skirmish, in which Captain O'Donald, of the 11th Missouri,
was wounded in the arm. A few prisoners were taken.</p>

<p>This town was situated on a high bluff, and the rebels had thrown up some
earthworks, but left as soon as they saw the gunboats. Few people were living
in the town.</p>

<p>About the first of April Banks moved, with his long train of wagons, in the
direction of Shreveport; the cavalry in advance, and the 13th corps, what there
was of it, in support of the cavalry. Skirmishing commenced early, and was
kept up until in the afternoon, when the rebels were discovered to be pretty
strong in force in our front, having a good position. The cavalry attacked them
without hesitation, and after a pretty severe fight, drove the rebels. The loss on
our side was light. They were driven several miles this day, which was the 7th
of April. Our men drove them in every instance until the 8th, when the 13th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>corps were forced to fall back, and all their cannon and wagon train were captured,
and out of 2,600 men, only half of them escaped.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th the march commenced, with cavalry in advance,
the 13th corps as support, their train next to them, and Banks and his invincible
19th brought up the rear, while Smith and Mowers with their guerrillas were
left behind to guard Banks' everlasting train. It was train enough for 150,000
men, and it took all of Smith's army to guard it while landing from the boats.
We were soon in marching order, and on the 7th got started, following Banks'
grand army. Rain fell this day, and laid the dust. Our march was through a
heavy pine timbered country; water was scarce. Marched this day about 16
miles, came to a halt. It was a long dreary march. Very few houses could be
seen. Next morning were on the move again. Marched this day about 19
miles, and came to a halt in the rear of a small town called Pleasant Hill. Here
we went into camp for the night. Reports began to be circulated through the
regiment that the army under Banks was badly whipped, and things began to
look gloomy, as the truth came to us that the 13th corps were all killed or captured,
with all their cannon and wagon train. Let me ask, who will have to
answer for the manner in which this expedition was conducted, and the many
brave men who fell a sacrifice to an immense cotton speculation? Who ever
heard of a General skirmishing with a wagon train? All were sent right up in
front, and our advance went as far as Sabine Cross Roads, 70 miles from Shreveport,
and here the battle commenced. A brigade of infantry was sent to support
the cavalry. The rebel lines were in the shape of a horse-shoe, and into
this our men moved, when a heavy fire was opened from all sides. There was no
chance of forming our lines, as the wagon train was in the way, and after a desperate
resistence, our ammunition being all expended, our men broke and fled in
all directions. Many of them fell into the hands of the enemy. Men and
horses were so mixed up they could not be rallied again. The cavalry were
forced to fall back, and some of them rode through the lines and caused confusion
among the men. Reinforcements were sent for, but did not arrive in time.
The invincible 19th got there at last and formed their lines for battle. The
enemy were steadily driving our men; on they went, not dreaming that they
were hastening to destruction. When they got within short range, a deadly fire
of musketry and artillery were poured into them. The rebels came to a halt,
and returned the fire, and soon the battle raged fiercely, neither side yielding an
inch. Volley after volley was given and received into their very faces. At
length the rebels yielded and fell back&mdash;our men did not follow up their advantage,
when night closed the bloody scene. The loss was heavy on both
sides. Kirby Smith was said to be in command.</p>

<p>Banks ordered a retreat. He and his negroes were hastening back to Grandecore.
We could see the wagons getting to the river as fast as possible, and all
day of the 9th the wagons could be seen passing. Two divisions of the 16th
corps had arrived, and were waiting orders, when on the morning of the 9th
three companies of the 33d Missouri regiment was detailed to guard our train.&mdash;Every
fire was put out and a guard was stationed all around our wagon train.&mdash;The
19th had fell back to Pleasant Hill, and as Banks could not command an
army he gave the command to Smith and Mower, who immediately formed their
men in line of battle.</p>

<p>The place where this battle was fought was on a high ridge, an old field separating
both armies. The artillery was placed in position on the ridge. All
around this old cotton field was a thick growth of heavy timber and underbrush.
In this our lines were formed in the shape of a horse-shoe. Artillery was
placed to sweep this open field, and a cannonade was kept up on the rebels, who
occupied the timber in front of our men, and were considerably annoyed by a
twelve pound howitzer which was throwing shell amongst them. As there
was no good position for the enemy to use artillery very little was used. A
force of cavalry was sent out to bring on an engagement. Skirmishing commenced
immediately, and was kept up for some time, and they were slowly
driven back until Price's arrival with reinforcements, when the attack was ordered
to commence at once, about 5 o'clock P. M. When the enemy were seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>forming their lines in the edge of the timber, every preparation was made to receive
them. The 19th corps formed part of the first line. They were seen advancing
in three lines. On they came, their object being to outflank us, but
were met at every point. Still they came, firing as they advanced, until they arrived
within a short distance of our lines, when every gun opened upon them,
and as one man fell another took his place. Still they advanced, but they were
mowed down like grass. A brigade of cavalry, supported by infantry, only three
men of which escaped, made a charge. It was met on the right by the 24th
Missouri regiment, and most nobly it was done. Its loss was heavy, one hundred
and eighteen killed and wounded. The infantry flanked them and they had to
change their position, and it was then they suffered most. All of the regiments
suffered that formed this line, as it was on the extreme right. As they could not
turn the flanks they fell back and massed their forces for another encounter. A
brisk cannonade was kept up all the time, which was killing and wounding their
men at every discharge. The 19th corps broke their first line of battle and
formed with Smith's men, and <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Hill's brigade formed in the centre, as it was
ordered to the front, and arrived in time to take part in the engagement. The
33d Missouri and 35th Iowa were laying down when the rebels were said to be advancing
again. They came on with their accustomed yell, when they were again
met with as warm a reception as in their first attempt to break our lines. It was
their object to break the centre, but in this they failed. They were met by the
western boys. Missouri against Missouri, brother against brother, met in the
deadly strife for the mastery of the field. Charge after charge had been made,
still the contest went on. The rebel dead lay in heaps along the whole line, and
the shouts of the combatants nearly drowned the roar of artillery and the noise
of battle. Seven thousand rifles with artillery, were making sad havoc in their
ranks. It had raged furiously for two hours, when their lines were seen to
waver. Mower, who was riding where the bullets rained the thickest, waving
his sword, gave the command forward and give the rebels the cold steel, but they
could not stand such a desperate charge as this was. Mower crossed the field,
leading the men double-quick into the timber, where the rebels were trying to
rally for another charge, but a heavy volley was fired into their masses and they
broke and fled in all directions, throwing away their arms in their haste to get
away. They were driven from the field three miles, and if our forces had followed
the retreating enemy, would have retrieved our loss, and Smith and
Price's armies have been destroyed. As it was, all of our artillery was retaken,
but could not be got away on account of not having horses to haul it. It was
left on the field in the hands of the enemy, with most of our wounded. Banks
ordered a retreat. Smith and Mower strenuously opposed falling back; they
were for pursuing the enemy, who did not halt till they got twenty miles from
the field of battle; leaving some of their best officers on the field.</p>

<p>Their loss is not known, but was fully as large as ours, which was great, for it
was a hard fought battle, and could be counted one of the hardest of the war,
considering the forces engaged. The rebel forces were said to have two thousand
two hundred strong, cavalry and infantry. They thought to crush Smith and
Mowers and capture their two divisions, but did not succeed in getting one gun
or wagon from them, while Banks lost half of his artillery and a good many
wagons; also his whisky, paper collars, and ammunition supplies for ten days,
belonging to the 13th corps, was all taken. Our ammunition was made good use
of in the fight at Pleasant Hill, with our new Enfield rifles. The prisoners call
Banks their commissary. They made a requisition on him for sixty thousand rations,
and he filled it, giving them something better than we received, which was
canned fruit and full rations of whisky.</p>

<p>On the 11th we arrived at Grandecore without molestation, as the rebels had
no idea but that we were in close pursuit, until they sent in a flag of truce asking
permission to care for their wounded and bury their dead. There was no one
to receive it, and word was sent back. They soon returned and followed us.&mdash;Our
retreat commenced early in the morning of the 10th, the 16th corps bringing
up the rear. Went into camp and remained here for a week. The fleet had
followed us on our advance to Shreveport, and went to within thirty-five miles
of that place, when the order was sent to them to return, and it was barely in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>time to save the boats from destruction. They were not molested on the way
up, but on their way back suffered from sharp-shooters that lined the banks. A
battery was in position at a small town called Lacompt, distant eight miles from
here, and a force of cavalry and infantry were sent there and made them take
their battery and skedaddle. The gunboats could not make them leave, owing
to the high bank at this place. The fleet got back at last, gunboats in advance.
To clear the shore of rebel batteries they were placed on every available point,
but could not stand the fire from the gunboats long. The steamer Black Hawk
looked like a sieve, it was all perforated with bullets. Several men were killed
and wounded on it, but in this attempt to capture the Black Hawk they paid
dearly. They did not perceive the Black Monitor laying low in the water.&mdash;Green
marched his men down to the shore and ordered the boat to shove ashore,
but they were not so inclined, and the officer in command informed him that he
would try what virtue there was in cold iron. A heavy volley was fired into the
boat, when the Monitor opened her broad sides. The rebels found they were
charging on the wrong boat, and began to get out of the way as quick as they
could, but were not in time to escape the shell that was making such fearful
havoc in their ranks. They were shelled as long as they could be seen. Their
loss was about five hundred killed and wounded, with Green, who paid the penalty
of charging on a boat with a monitor in tow.</p>

<p>April 20th. After drawing rations, we left Grandecore, to return to Alexandria.
The rebels were determined we should not leave Louisiana, and were on
the move to intercept us from going back to Mississippi, at every opportunity
would attack our lines in front and rear, and at every point and place where
they could make a good stand.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th, being Sunday, the rebels commenced throwing
some shells into our camp, aiming at our wagon train, but did no damage to
trains or us until we got ready for them. Our cavalry then made some desperate
charges. The 16th Indiana and 6th Missouri cavalry, did the principal fighting,
with our line of skirmishers, while our regiment was drawn up in line of
battle and watching for an engagement with them, but they did not come to
taw.</p>

<p>We arrived at Alexandria after marching nearly one hundred miles. There
was fighting almost every day, either front or rear, but they were always met
with determination. Our cavalry would not be driven. The rebels would come
up and attack the rear, when the cavalry would hold the rebels until the infantry
could get the start, and then the cavalry would fall in and come on slowly,
the rebels following closely. Arrived at Alexandria with the loss of a few men.
While at that place, the report was brought into camp that the rebels were to
occupy the city on a certain day, and preparation was made to give them a warm
reception, if they choose to pay us a visit. A line of battle was formed a short
distance from town and we lay on our arms all night, but in the morning returned
to camp, as no enemy had appeared. While here, reinforcement for the 13th
corps arrived, and were sent out to the front, when orders came for another
move. Tents were left standing and, Mower's and Smith's divisions fell into
line and moved out to the front; came to a halt and remained in line waiting
orders. Skirmishing was going on in front and Banks' men were driving the
rebels, and several prisoners were taken. Several batteries opened on their lines
and they soon got out of harms way. The men under Smith and Mower fell
back about a mile, formed a line and were ordered to be ready to take arms any
moment. Nothing disturbed us this night, and early in the morning bugle
sounded for the men to fall in, when the advance was sounded and all were on
the march again, cavalry in advance. They soon fell in with the rebel pickets,
and skirmishing commenced quite early in the day. The enemy were driven
slowly, they disputed every foot of ground. Did not come to a halt until we
came to a place called Rodgers' Bayon. Here we stopped and eat our dinners,
when the brigade, under <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Hill, was ordered to the front to protect our wagon
train, as they were procuring forage at one of the plantations across the
bayou. The 6th Missouri cavalry being out in front, deserve praise for the manner
in which they held their position. They were forced back on account of superior
numbers, there being only two companies. Artillery was used by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>rebels and some of their shot came close to our lines, killing and wounding
eight of the cavalry. When the cavalry fell back the rebels came close enough
to use grape shot, and their guns could be plainly seen by us. After throwing a
few shells over us, doing no damage but killing the strength of the powder, they
desisted, and as it was nearly dark and our wagons were loaded, we returned to
Governor Moore's plantation, and there we had our camping grounds for ten
days. Corn was growing finely and wheat was ready for reaping, but everything
was destroyed. Governor Moore's family moved to Alexandria, and every
building was reduced to ashes. Picket skirmishing was going on most of the
time, causing constant alarm in camp. The water having fallen in the river,
boats could not get back to Alexandria without damming the river to make the
water deep enough for the gunboats to pass over the falls. All of the transports
got over at last except one, which was the Woodford. It was used as a hospital,
and sunk in getting above the falls and lay in the river. When the army passed
there all the sick had been taken off. After finishing the dam all the boats
passed through the channel except some of the iron-clads, of which the plating
had to be taken off to render them light enough to pass below the falls. Banks
was for destroying them, lest they should fall into the rebels' hands, but they got
over at last, when Banks got all of his boats loaded with cotton and niggers,
started for the Mississippi, 19th corps in advance, 13th next, and his invincible
wagon train, and last of all, Smith and Mower's guerrillas bringing up the rear.
Started from Moore's plantation, leaving nothing but a few shade trees to mark
the home of the rebel Governor, fell in with Banks' army three miles from this
place, on their way back. Our march was right along the river and the boats
were following us, the Monitor clearing the road of sharp-shooters, who lined
the banks of the river, and were doing their best to stop the progress of the
fleet down to the Mississippi. A few shell thrown amongst them caused them
to get out of danger before the land force could get to where they were. They
had captured some of the tin-clad fleet belonging to the Monitor, and several
transports. One had five hundred soldiers on it and only about a hundred got
to Alexandria. After running the gauntlet boats were sunk in the river as an
obstruction, but the gunboat soon made a road, passed through, and at last got
around to Simsport. Arrived about the 10th of May, no rain having fallen for
more than a month.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred but slight skirmishing with our advance until after passing
Fort D'Russey, at a place called Marksville Prairie, a small town three miles
from the fort. It was a flat, open country, and for miles could be seen a beautiful
tract of land, inhabited by French and Creoles, who treated the soldiers
with contempt, and very little respect was paid to the neutral flag that could be
seen on most all the houses on the prairie. The rebels resolved to make a stand
and give us battle. Their lines could be plainly seen. Preparation was made,
and the advance commenced. All of our army could be seen as they came on
and took their position in line of battle. Everything seemed to work like clock
work. It would be a sight for an artist. The blue coats could be seen as far as
the eye could reach, together with our long wagon train; the dust so thick it
was almost suffocating. Mowers moved his lines. Forward was the word, the
skirmishers in advance. The rebels had opened with several guns, and were
throwing shot over our lines, doing but little injury to us. A battery was opened
from our side, but could not remain long in position, as the rebels soon silenced
the guns. A force was sent to the left which caused them to back out of
our way and let us pass. Some of the non-veterans of the 11th were wounded,
and several of the 33d Missouri killed. The rebels were not heard from again
until next day, when our rear was attacked while crossing a bayou. They did
not gain anything by this, and were held in check. Presently they left the rear
and made a charge on the advance of the train. The negroes met the charge
and after killing two of them, left, leaving their major's body and horse in our
hands. A heavy guard was placed along the wagon train, and sappers were sent
in advance to examine the woods along the route.</p>

<p>The 19th corps was hurrying to the river as fast as they could get along, the
13th corps being next, and Smith's and Mowers' brought up the rear. The rebels
were endeavoring to reach Yellow Bayou and occupy their old works, but were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>beat in the race, and at night our men occupied the works, and after crossing
the bayou camped in line of battle, fronting the rebels. The cavalry acting as
picket guard, was out about a mile in front. This night we slept without being
disturbed, and in the morning the cavalry was forced back, when infantry was
sent to support the cavalry. The rebels were heavily reinforced. Paul Neck,
a Texas Colonel, was said to have been in command, the best artillerist in the
South. His practice was so good and aim so accurate, our batteries could not
withstand the fire from their guns, as they fired by volley. The infantry was
formed in line and started on double-quick for the field where the rebels were
supposed to be. A bayou was on one side and a heavy swamp on the other, and
in this and the open space the rebel's lines were formed, with batteries in position;
so they had decidedly the advantage of our men. Briers and weeds were
so thick in the swamp we could not get through at all. Skirmishers were ordered
forward and the advance commenced. Their lines could not be discovered
until our men were right on them. A volley was given at short range and a
charge was made, when we came to a stand. Still, the rebels slowly falling
back. Another advance was made, and this time the fighting was quite severe.
Our men were so close every shot told; and in this charge about three hundred
prisoners were taken. The artillery could not be used on account of the men
being mixed up so in the charge. But when they were falling back they suffered
most, the rebels using grape. Colonel Hill's son was killed. Hill's brigade
suffered severely, and himself wounded in the foot. The battle continued most
all day. Two brigades whipped about one thousand rebels, they having the advantage
of position. Two of the guns used were taken from the gunboat, and
our artillerists could not reach them as they were placed out of range. Their
own report of their loss was twenty-five hundred, while ours would not amount
to more than five hundred. It was a hot sultry day in May, and a good many
of the soldiers fell struck down with the excessive heat.</p>

<p>The rebels left our front that night, and reinforcements being sent to relieve
those in front, returned to our old place of camping. At night enjoyed a good
sleep, and in the morning, May 19th, started to Atchafalaya Bayou. The rebels
brought a battery along with them and commenced shelling our rear. A battery
was left to protect the rear until everything was got safely away, when the
artillerists limbered up and got out of danger. The rebels shelled them as long
as they could be seen, doing no damage. Banks had been crossing his men and
trains for two days, and as they were out of danger, Smith's guerrillas, who
were guarding the rear, were ordered to prepare for crossing the Atchafalaya
and march eleven miles and take the boats.</p>

<p>A bridge was constructed of boats lashed side by side and plank layed across
the front of them, answering very well for a pontoon. On arriving at the
bridge we were not long in crossing; we got over that day and encamped.&mdash;Whisky
was distributed to the boys and some of them became quite merry, as
there was no danger of being waked up in the morning by the enemy's shell
falling in their midst; and were out of hearing of the enemy's cannon for once
in two months. As everything was got over safe the 19th, on the 20th started
for the boats. Encamped on the bank of the river until everything was put on
board, and we were soon on the way to Vicksburg again. As we were leaving,
Banks' grand army could be seen moving in the direction of New Orleans, his
expedition having been a grand failure on his part. Loss in men was about ten
thousand; three hundred wagons, about three thousand mules and horses, and
several batteries of artillery; also several transports and gunboats fell to the
rebels to pay for a few bales of cotton, leaving the bereaved friends at home to
mourn the loss of those who fell sacrifices in this disastrous expedition, got up
for political purposes and cotton. You can see how well it was managed; it was
sent into the fight by detail, and as soon as one regiment or brigade was whipped
another was sent in, and in this way a whole army could have been annihilated.
But when they met Mower's and Smith's guerrillas, Banks was pleased
to call them, as they did not wear paper collars, as some of his men did; found
they had to fight with men that were not afraid of a greycoat, and well did the
army sustain their credit. Mower and Smith have won the confidence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>men in this little band, who arrived at Vicksburg about the 25th. After remaining
here for several days, took boats and went to Memphis; the boats came
to anchor at a place called Sunnyside. Between Greenville and Memphis, on
the way up the river, the rebels were reported to be in force, and it was with extreme
danger boats could go either up or down the river. Some cavalry were
sent out to reconnoitre, who fell in with some rebel scouts and had a short skirmish,
killing and wounding a few of them.</p>

<p>June 5th, some rain fell. Most of the troops landed and slept on shore. All
night long you could hear a noise as if artillery was moving. Next morning
commenced raining. While the fleet went by water a force was sent by land to
clear the shore of artillery. The marines started in advance and skirmishing
commenced quite early, the enemy driving stubbornly. The 2d brigade supported
by the marines, 5th Minnesota, 47th Illinois, and 8th Wisconsin, drove
the rebels across a bayou called Muddy Bayou, where artillery was in position.
Hill's brigade was ordered to support the 2d brigade, form our lines on theirs,
but by some mistake were ordered to charge and take the battery.</p>

<p>June 10th. Returned to the 11th Missouri again, but were not destined to remain
long inactive. After rejoining the regiment orders came to prepare to
march, when they got on the cars at Memphis and went to Moscow, and there
remained until the bridges were repaired all along the railroad to La Grange,
when the cars commenced running again, and a daily communication was kept
up from La Grange to Memphis. The regiment left on the 16th, acting as guard
to the railroad until they arrived at La Grange, when they went into camp and
remained there until July 5th. Troops began to arrive here in great numbers,
and every indication of some important movement going on. A great quantity
of provisions sent over the road to La Grange, and when everything was ready
two divisions of infantry, one division of cavalry and a brigade of negroes, all
under command of A. J. Smith, Mower was in command of the first division,
Moore, Colonel of the 21st Missouri, commanded the third division, Bouton was
in command of the negroes, and Grierson was in command of the cavalry. All
started from La Grange on the 5th of July, and went about five miles, came to
a halt and remained there until morning. Started again on the morning of the
6th. After marching about twelve miles came to a halt and waited for the rear
to come up, it was late getting into camp. Next morning resumed our march
again and passed through Ripley. Here we discovered that the rebels were
watching us. The cavalry skirmished. The rebels were commanded by Forrest,
a brother of <abbr title="General">Gen.</abbr> Forrest. About 3,000 mounted infantry took a position on a
high hill awaiting our approach. Our cavalry by some means got information
of their whereabouts, and got in their rear, and soon made them seek shelter in
flight, leaving 11 dead on the field, and 14 wounded. Our loss was none killed
or wounded. The cavalry pursued them for several miles beyond Ripley. We
went from there to Pontotoc; there we remained one day and rested. Rebels
were reported in force in our front, but no serious demonstrations were made
until we arrived within 10 miles of Tupelo. While we were marching along the
rebels made a charge, firing a heavy volley of musketry, creating some confusion
among the teamsters, some of them running into the brush and leaving their
teams to take care of themselves. The rebels were soon met and made to leave
in a hurry, having accomplished nothing but killing and wounding a few of our
men. They suffered severely in this attack. The negroes being in the rear, on
them they vented their spite, but in every instance were repulsed, the negroes
showing them no quarters. A heavy guard was stationed along the train which
resisted every attempt of the rebels to capture any of our wagon train. Having
tried the train to their satisfaction, and seeing that it would be impossible to get
any of our hard-tack, took up a position in front of us, forming their lines across
the road, with two batteries of artillery. In this way they divided the army.
Smith, with most of the cavalry and 3d division of infantry, was hastening as
fast as possible to Tupelo, where there was a very good position. The cavalry
soon reached this place and commenced tearing up the railroad track, leaving
Mowers with the 1st division to guard the train and bring up the rear. The
rebels being beat in the race to Tupelo, turned their attention to the rear, and
expected by dividing the army they could easily whip and capture each division
separately. They reckoned without their host, for our men were ready for them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>The rebels fired a volley, and charged with terrific yells on our advancing
columns, but Waterhouse's and the 2d Iowa batteries were soon in position to
receive them. On they came, hoping to capture these guns as they were waiting
to deal death and destruction among them. All at once a deadly fire from cannon
and musket was opened upon them at short range, and so desperate was the
conflict that most all of the horses of one gun were either killed or disabled,
and 11 of their men lay dead in front of the guns. This fight lasted an hour
when they were driven off. They used two batteries, but being at long range,
did not damage us much. Everything was hurried up, and the rebels with all
their shelling could not stop our wagon train, and we were soon out of range of
shell.</p>

<p>July 13th and 14th. In this attempt they were severely punished, having accomplished
nothing, and leaving a number of their dead and wounded in our
hands. This fight took place about five miles from Tupelo. We marched this
day 18 miles, and encamped on the side of a hill two and a half miles from
Tupelo. Tired and weary we were soon in the arms of slumber, being waked by
the drum in the morning.</p>

<p>Everything arrived safe that evening. They came up and attacked the rear
again, but were met by the negroes and cavalry, which were drawn up in line of
battle to receive them. Failing again to fall back under a heavy fire from our
men. Our loss was slight. A heavy picket guard was stationed all around our
camp to guard against a night attack. A desultory fire was kept up, doing but
little damage on either side. Things remained in this state until the next morning,
when our lines were formed for battle. The rebels were seen advancing in
heavy force to attack us. Every preparation was made to receive them. On
they came, supported by artillery, to within 150 yards of our lines, when a
deadly fire of grape and canister was thrown into their ranks, mowing them
down like grass, and soon they were forced to fall back. They rallied again for
another desperate effort to take our guns that were making such sad havoc in
their ranks, but the second time they were driven back with great slaughter,
and they rallied for the third and last charge, to break our lines, but they were
met with a deadly storm of bullets no human could withstand. In vain their
officers urged them on, and swore that any man who was discovered going to the
rear should be shot, but all their efforts were unavailing, they could not stand
such deadly volleys from cannon and musketry. A charge was made, and the
rebels were driven from the field at the point of the bayonet. A few prisoners
were taken. Our loss was slight compared to theirs. They suffered severely in
officers&mdash;five colonels lay dead on the field&mdash;Nelson, Forrest, Harris, Fitzpatrick,
Falkner&mdash;all had fallen victims to their unholy cause, along with over a
thousand more brave men; some of them mere boys, who had left their homes
to drive the invaders from their soil, as they called us, but did not succeed in
making us leave. We held our position for two days. It was in the rear of
Harrisburg, a short distance from Tupelo, with a swamp on both sides, in front
was an open country, with a few trees, thick under brush and weeds, for sharpshooters
to lay concealed in, and pick off men. The ground was a gentle slope
where the rebels had to advance, and we had decidedly the advantage of position.
They tried hard to drive us from it, but they were out-generaled. Smith,
with the first division, gained the hill first, took up a position on it, and resolved
to give the rebels battle. Being defeated in the day time, thought they would
try a night attack, and take our men by surprise, but our men were waiting for
them, and after an hour's hard fighting were at length compelled to give up the
contest and wait for morning to renew it.</p>

<p>The armies lay in sight of each other all night, thinking that on the morrow
some would sleep beneath the sod. Before morning the rebels withdrew. The
negroes fought well, and drove the rebels in every instance. A colonel of the
9th Minnesota, commanding a brigade in the 1st division, was killed; he was
shot by a sharp-shooter through the heart. The rebels were commanded by
Lee and Forrest. It was reported that Forrest was killed, but I think it was a
mistake, there was no such good news for us. Their force was said to be 10,000
strong, mostly mounted infantry. They did not use much artillery in the engagement;
it was always off so far that it did but little damage to us. Their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>shot went crashing through the trees over our heads, doing us no damage. They
thought to drive us from our position, as our lines were formed in the swamp to
guard against flank movements. The rebels were said to be moving towards
our right, and on this they made the night attack, but were defeated in every
attempt to break through our lines.</p>

<p>A flag of truce was sent in asking permission to take care of their dead and
wounded, but it was not so much to take care of their wounded as to gain an
advantage over us. Our generals suspected their design, which was to advance
and take us unawares, and they were not permitted to advance. All of their
wounded were brought from the field along with ours, and received such care
as the times would allow.</p>

<p>July 15. We still hold the hill in front of the rebels. Skirmishing was still
going on. Our wagon train commenced moving out, the cavalry in advance, the
3d division next, and the 1st division to bring up the rear, with some cavalry as
support. The rebels were seen advancing in force when the second brigade was
ordered to support the 2d Iowa battery, which was sending its compliments in
shell into the rebel ranks, who were advancing. Here the 11th Missouri lost
four men wounded, who were all struck by the same shell, a captain and three of
his men, none of them dangerously wounded. Captain Clealand was struck
twice, but will soon be able to take command of his company again. Here we
remained as support for a short time, when our position was changed and we
were ordered to form our lines on the 3d brigade. When we arrived opposite
the 3d brigade they raised a yell and over the barricades they went, firing as
they advanced. The rebels fled as fast as possible to their horses, which they
left in their rear. Our forces watched them for about a mile, and we could see
their wagon train getting out of the way in great haste. The 2d Iowa was accelerating
their movements by sending a few shell amongst them. A charge
was made by some Iowa cavalry, but they found the rebels too strong for them
and they had to fall back with slight loss, when the order came for us to fall in
and follow the train, as it had all got started on its way back to La Grange. In
this morning's engagement the rebel loss was over a hundred. While we were
watching the rear they made a demonstration on the train, but were driven off
after some severe fighting. They suffering severely in every instance. An Indiana
battery was used to some purpose. We marched this day only about seven
miles, and here the 3d division waited until the rear came up, was in camp
early this evening, and the rebels were following the rear closely. A trap was
set, and into it they easily ran. The 21st Missouri regiment was laying in ambush,
and the rebels marched right along, not dreaming that they were rushing
on death and destruction. The cavalry were holding them in check but were
longing for the infantry to come to their assistance. Soon the first brigade was
heavily engaged. The 114th Illinois charged upon them as they were drawn up
in line along a cornfield, capturing one piece of artillery and thirty prisoners.&mdash;They
fled, pursued by our cavalry, leaving five hundred killed and wounded in
our hands. They did not molest us again that night, as they got enough of trying
to capture wagon trains. They found to their cost, Sturgis was not in command.
Where danger was, you would find Mower or Smith. They were always
on the alert to prevent surprise, and it was owing to their vigilance that
we escaped so well. We returned to La Grange the 21st, having nothing to impede
our progress from Tupelo after the last fight. We marched through a very
hilly country, up one hill and down another. All day long we toiled on under
the scorching sun. A great many died from the effects of the sun, being extremely
warm. But the road was shaded with trees that grew along the path,
and the men did not suffer so much on the way back. There was plenty of
good water on this route, but provisions had become scarce and our allowance
was third rations of hard-tack with no coffee and very little meat, and that was
fresh beef without salt. Some lived on green apples until we arrived at a small
town called Salem, where we received full rations of hard-tack, half rations coffee
without sugar, and fourth of meat. Then we fared a little better. From
here we went to Davis' Mills, and there encamped for the night. This was only
five miles from our place of starting. All the train was correlled before night.
Next morning marched to La Grange to the cars for Memphis, where we arrived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>at our old camp. A train ran off the track the day we started, owing to some
imperfection in the road. A few of the passengers were injured. This caused
delay in getting to Memphis, but we got back at last with most of our wagon
train. Marched two hundred miles, whipped Forrest in every engagement, took
one hundred and fifty prisoners with one piece of artillery, killing and wounding
two thousand five hundred of the enemy by their own account. Our loss in
all will not amount to four hundred and fifty. The rebels in Mississippi received
a lesson that will not be forgotten by them soon. There was severe fighting for
three days, but in every instance they got the worst of it.</p>


<h3><i>Finish of the Red River Expedition&mdash;Battle of Muddy
Bayou, June 6, 1864.</i></h3>

<p>When the yell was raised two regiments started on the double-quick to take
the batteries at the point of the bayonet, but on reaching the bayou could not
get across. The brigade suffered severely in this charge. Four men in the 33d
Missouri were struck down by one shot, and the loss in two regiments, 33d <abbr title="Missouri">Mo.</abbr>
and 35th Iowa, was 80 men. One of their guns was masked. Our artillery did
not render us any assistance. Eight guns were playing on us as we advanced,
until we got close enough to them to use our guns, and they were forced to
leave under a heavy fire. Their loss was not known. Five more of the 11th
<abbr title="Missouri">Mo.</abbr>, non-veterans, were wounded; two of them had to have a leg each amputated;
one has since died, a corporal in company B, named Columbus Roe. This
makes fifteen killed and wounded in this expedition of the 11th Missouri non-veterans.
Our men crossed over and the cavalry pursued the retreating rebels
hauling their guns from the field by hand, as our lines were so close to them
they could not use horses until they got out of range. A battery was crossed
over, and our men shelled them as long as they were in sight.</p>

<p>The houses along the road were filled with their wounded, and their loss must
have been as heavy as ours. Marmaduke was said to have been in command.
We camped at town called Lakeville one night and returned to the boats, which
were awaiting us, taking our wounded with us. Got on board of the transport
Freestone, and arrived at Memphis, where the 11th Missouri veterans were said
to be. Remained two days with 33d Missouri.</p>

<p><abbr title="William">Wm.</abbr> L. Barnum was elected Colonel of the veterans, being raised from a
captain to lieutenant colonel, and on Websters death took command of the
11th Missouri regiment, and on the regiment re-enlisting was elected Colonel.
George Weber resigned on account of disability, and went home with the veterans.</p>

<p>Our loss in three years, of officers, was Captain Moore, who died at Cape
Girardeau; Captain Singleton, killed at Iuka; Captain Hollister, killed at Corinth,
Oct. 4, '62; Andrew J. Weber, June 29, '63, and Adjutant Bookings, May
22, in front of Vicksburg, killed by a rebel sharp-shooter.</p>

<p>As my time was drawing to a close, it being the 5th day of August, did not
take part in the next expedition under A. J. Smith; and when the veterans left
Memphis on another expedition, the non-veterans went to St. Louis, having been
mustered out at Memphis, and receiving our discharges, pay and bounty, each
one went his own way.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
